# README for Greg Walker

Hello! My name is Greg Walker, and you may sometimes see my name pop up as Michael Walker. My first name is Michael, but I go by my middle name. I apologize in advance if you have trouble finding me in an address book somewhere. I use the pronouns he/him.

## Who am I?

### Non-work

I live in Kansas City, Missouri, home of the best barbecue in the world. I enjoy running, even though it tends to hurt me, I have a fantastic dog named Winry, and I‚Äôm married to a wonderful husband. He cooks and bakes a lot, so you may hear me talking about food from time to time.

I enjoy drawing and felting. Right now I am drawing a ‚Äúthis day in history‚Äù comic every day. I have felted a few animals, such as a sheep, a llama, and a chicken. I‚Äôm not super talented at either, but they are fun and I enjoy them!

### Work

I‚Äôm a consulting engineer at 18F. I mostly write Javascript these days, but I can read Python and Ruby well enough to review it, and I‚Äôm trying to get better at writing Python. I‚Äôm pretty happy writing both frontend and backend code, though making good CSS is hard for me.

I‚Äôve worked on state Medicaid consulting projects, other acquisitions consulting projects, and even a build here or there. I really enjoy collaborating with my teams, sharing what I know and learning from them, so we can make better decisions.

I think one of my core strengths is communication, both with my 18F colleagues and with our partners. That can be during meetings, in writing, or even code reviews.

## Scheduling // Time zones

I‚Äôm on Central Time. I am generally available from 9am to 5pm CT (10 ET/7 PT to 6 ET /3 PT). While I‚Äôm usually around, I prefer meetings no earlier than 10, but we can work it out if there‚Äôs a meeting that needs to come earlier. I‚Äôm currently debating whether to tweak my working hours so I can get better quality sleep.

I try to keep my calendar up-to-date. There is a recurring block marked off for lunch. I ask that you respect it ‚Äì if you see that I‚Äôm free immediately before or after, you can schedule over my planned lunch time, but please give me a heads-up so I can move the block. If we have to meet through lunch, I may be late or excuse myself to go make lunch, and I will eat on camera. I‚Äôm not being rude, I‚Äôm just taking care of myself. üôÇ

## Goals

### Learning goals

I want to keep learning more about design and how to put it at the center of software product development. I also want to learn a lot more about how to improve the safety and inclusivity of the work environment I‚Äôm in, and how to help us reach out to a diverse group of people when we‚Äôre recruiting people to apply for jobs.

### Career goals

The bottom line is that my career goal is to help government deliver services to the people it serves. I‚Äôve worked most of my career as a federal civil servant, starting with a lot of disaster response projects and more recently with human services projects. I‚Äôd love to stay here my whole career. Government presents a unique set of problems to solve, barriers to solving them, and level of impact once solved. If I can‚Äôt stay in the federal service for the rest of my career, I would look into working for a state or local government.

## You can lean on me to ‚Ä¶

- Be honest when I see something that worries or bothers me. I may not speak up immediately, but I also won‚Äôt let it go too long before I say something.

- Support you and your voice, if you feel like you‚Äôre being undervalued or unheard. I‚Äôll back you up and proactively refer to your judgement to make sure everyone appreciates what you bring.

- Communicate clearly, especially on technical details. This is a passion of mine. I might even draw you a picture.

- Review code. I like reviewing code.

- Be serious when necessary, but otherwise I‚Äôll probably be more laid back and goofy.

## How to support me as we work together

I talk a lot on Slack. I try to thread my long stream-of-consciousness conversations with myself so they don‚Äôt bug everyone. I don‚Äôt need a lot of acknowledgement, but I appreciate patience with how chatty I can be sometimes. Often I‚Äôm just working out something in my own head and typing it out in Slack serves as an alternative to talking about it with someone else.

I‚Äôm not good in meetings that aren‚Äôt pretty relevant to me for more than about 30 minutes. If we‚Äôre going to have a long meeting to cover a variety of topics, only some of which are relevant to my work, I would rather split that into several meetings so people can attend just the ones for them, or normalize having people leave when their topic is done. I absolutely will zone out of meetings that don‚Äôt seem actionable or relevant for me. Some of that is up to me to figure out, but I appreciate my teammates helping me with that ‚Äì sometimes a thing is relevant to me and I wouldn‚Äôt realize it without someone showing me!

## How to support me as a person

Big groups of people are exhausting to me. If we‚Äôre working together in-person, there‚Äôs a fair chance that at the end of the day, I won‚Äôt want to hang out anymore. It‚Äôs not personal, I‚Äôm probably just really tired and need some quiet and cartoons. So if we‚Äôre working together and I opt out of after-hours social time, please just be understanding.

I have generalized anxiety disorder which manifests as feeling like an upset stomach, so sometimes I may choose to skip an IRL or onsite meal, or I may leave a meal early. My anxiety is pretty well-controlled so this doesn‚Äôt come up as often anymore, but if I‚Äôm tired, I‚Äôm more likely to experience anxiety symptoms.

I will eat lunch. I will not lose the war on lunch. That might mean that I eat during a meeting or call. You can support me by just‚Ä¶ being okay with that. üôÇ

## Ways of working together

I am pretty flexible on how a team works together. I don‚Äôt think I have strong opinions about what I like. As long as the team is respectful and our team processes have value that is reasonably proportionate to the effort, I‚Äôll pretty happily play along.

## Teamwork preferences

What I want most from my team is to treat each other with respect, dignity, and trust. From there, I feel like open and honest communication almost flows naturally, which will do a lot to drive a successful team. Honest communication means the team will disagree about things, while respect and dignity mean the team will work through those disagreements together and reach an agreeable solution without ignoring or belittling anyone‚Äôs perspective.

## Technical preferences

I‚Äôm a strong advocate for using the best tool for the job, which leaves open a lot of possibilities for what is ‚Äúbest.‚Äù It will vary task to task, environment to environment, and even person to person. To that end, I don‚Äôt have strong preferences around things like code editors, programming languages, or frameworks.

I‚Äôm also an advocate for consistency in the product. From a developer perspective, that means consistent code. For that, I have a strong preference for using tools like code linters and formatters (both, not one or the other ‚Äì they solve different problems) to keep code consistent across different developers. These let us make some preference choices (or defer to the tools‚Äô defaults) and never think about them again. Never again will I argue tabs vs. spaces with anyone ‚Äì I just don‚Äôt care, as long as it‚Äôs consistent.

## Feedback preferences

I accept feedback however you choose to give it, whether that‚Äôs an email, a Slack message, a Github comment, or a video call. Public or private doesn‚Äôt matter to me too much. If you‚Äôre calling out some hurtful or bad behavior, I‚Äôd ask two things: 1) bring it up as soon as you feel comfortable so we can address it head-on and 2) assume that I didn‚Äôt intend to be hurtful. Intentions matter less than impact, though, so please don‚Äôt let that assumption stop you from correcting me.

I am a little shy, so positive feedback can come sparingly or in private. I do like to know that I‚Äôm doing good or helpful things, but too much of it feeds into my imposter syndrome (e.g., ‚ÄúI‚Äôve fooled them all so well!‚Äù) and makes me self-conscious. Negative feedback may make me self-conscious too, but that‚Äôs a worthwhile tradeoff for being able to grow and be a better teammate.
