# Working with Me

### Intro

- **Name pronunciation**: gr-EGG WALL-ker
- **Pronouns**: he/him
- **Chapter**: 18F Engineering
- **Started**: January, 2016
- **Term out**: January, 2028
- **Location**: Kansas City, Missouri
- **Working hours**: 8:30 am CT to 5:00 pm CT

### Skills

- backend coding (mostly Node.js these days, but I can get around in Python,
  and I would welcome an excuse to play with Swift or C# again)
- "back of the frontend" coding (the Javascript parts of the frontend; I can do
  HTML, but CSS for anything complex is a struggle)
- communicating without jargon

### Work style preferences

- I'm usually at work by 9am central time, but I'd prefer not to take meetings
  before 10am. If we need an earlier meeting, just let me know and we can make
  it work; just please show me some grace because I'm not an early person.
- I eat lunch. If you need to schedule through my lunch block, please try to let
  me know beforehand, and also don't be surprised if I eat during our meeting.
- I'm generally pretty flexible, otherwise, and I don't mind changing things up
  if it turns out something isn't working for someone.

### Projects I've worked on

_(in chronological order)_

- **State Medicaid acquisition consulting**  
  Starting in 2016, we first worked with states through the Centers for
  Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to help figure out paths towards
  modernizing their MMIS systems, and then later we worked directly with the
  states. We realized that MMIS systems were too complex to start with, so we
  transitioned more to working with eligibility and enrollment (E&E) systems.
  These projects involved migrating data and workflows from mainframes, and our
  focus was on working with our state partners to outline a technical approach
  and build an acquisition plan for getting good vendors in to help the state
  implement the plan. We also worked on getting our state partners ready to
  work in a user-centered, iterative way and to take ownership of the products
  they were building.

- **CMS APD research and eAPD**  
  Following our work with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)
  on state Medicaid systems, we asked if we could help CMS research their
  Advance Planning Document (APD) process, because we had come to suspect it
  was an impediment to states adopting the best practices CMS was asking of
  them. Our research led CMS to choose to build a web tool for building APDs,
  called eAPD. We worked with CMS product leads on building the tool while also
  helping them practice product management and ownership for about 3 years. We
  rolled off shortly after bringing on a vendor team. The product is planned
  to go live in 2021, and our product friends at CMS are still driving the eAPD
  ship. This is probably my favorite project from my time at 18F so far.

- **10x phase ones**  
  Various. I don't think they were anything special; pretty typical phase ones.

- **USFS firewoord permitting**  
  The US Forest Service (USFS) was building a web application to allow members
  of the public to buy permits to harvest firewood from national forests. 18F's
  role was product coaching and helping to provide technical oversite and
  quality assurance. I joined the project in-progress. Unfortunately, our USFS
  teammates weren't in a good position to properly own and manage the product at
  the time, largely due to being shorthanded and very busy with other tasks, so
  the project ended early.

- **CMS CARTS**
  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Children's Health
  Insurance Program (CHIP) was building a new web application for states to
  report on program access, service quality, and individuals' experiences with
  CHIP services. 18F was co-developing the app with a vendor team. I joined the
  project in-progress. While everyone on the team - CMS, 18F, and the vendor -
  was committed to the work and trying their best, for various reasons, the
  project was not successful. In this project, we had to navigate some difficult
  interpersonal issues and terminate our engagement early.

- **NASA SBIR**  
  Another project I joined in progress. 18F was originally supposed to help NASA
  build an acquisition to replace the vendor on their SBIR system, which is the
  tool small business use to apply for research contracts (essentially). Later,
  NASA decided to keep the same vendor, so we transitioned to working with NASA
  to map out a path to product ownership, iterative development, and moving the
  existing SBIR system into NASA-owned infrastructure.

- **CMS contract terminiation path analysis**  
  We worked with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to do some
  research into how and why state Medicaid IT contracts were terminated to try
  to figure out ways to improve outcomes. This was a research-intensive project
  that involved a bunch of interviews, and we learned a bunch about the
  incentives at play. In coordination with our partners at CMS, we wrote a
  report that outlined our findings and offered some proposals for how to
  improve the odds of contracts producing value. Our recommendations touched on
  the roles of CMS, the states, and the IT vendors, and were well-received by
  everyone involved, including the vendor community.

- **State of Washington IE&E modernization**
  Joined in progress. The state of Washington is currently in the process of
  rethinking their public benefits system, including potentially integrating
  various programs. One potential starting point is integrating eligibility and
  enrollment for all the programs into a single application. We joined the state
  to help work through building out the first parts of a new digital system  in
  a user-centered, iterative way. Unfortunately, due to internal TTS issues, we
  were not able to continue this engagement and had to end it before we felt we
  had made much progress. Our partners at Washington were great and eager to
  eager to adopt new practices, but we just didn't have enough time (and they
  didn't either, honestly) to establish those.

- **ACF OPRE**
  Joined in progress. We worked with the Administration of Children and Family's
  (ACF) Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation (OPRE). OPRE is responsible
  for a significant amount of research and evaluation grants, and they have a
  legacy system that helps them track information about those various ongoing
  projects. However, the legacy system no longer meets their needs and OPRE
  staff are forced to manually collect and correlate a significant amount of
  information. We originally intended to help OPRE by starting to build a new
  product and eventually hand it off to a vendor team. However, due to internal
  TTS constraints, the engagement was truncated and we ultimately focused on
  helping OPRE write a solicitation and select a vendor to build the entire
  product.
