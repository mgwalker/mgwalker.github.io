      June 5 - Trans women and drag queens riot at Compton‘s Cafeteria
    </h2>
    <div>
      <img alt="inclusive pride heart" src="/assets/pride-images/image1.png" />
      How far back do you think the fight for transgender rights and equality
      goes? Well, since the dawn of gender norms, most likely. But we can trace
      the modern movement to at least 1952, following a high-profile sex
      reassignment surgery that captured the public’s attention. Within a
      decade, there were dozens of gender clinics scattered around the US, and
      gender-affirming medical care was gaining acceptance.
      <br /><br />
      In the mid-1960s, transgender women teamed up with drag queens in San
      Francisco’s Tenderloin district to form a social and political
      organization to advocate for their rights and needs. They met at Compton’s
      Cafeteria to plan their activities. However, because they generally used
      the location solely as a meeting spot and never bought anything, staff
      eventually began calling police to have them removed.
      <br /><br />
      In August 1966, three years before the Stonewall Riots, police were called
      to the cafeteria to oust the women and queens. But they used force and
      were not prepared to be met with force in response. The activists hit
      police with their purses and high-heeled shoes, as well as threw sugar
      shakers and other tableware at them. When police retreated into the
      streets to call for backup, the drag queens and women followed them and
      fighting continued.
      <br /><br />
      This event was dubbed the Compton’s Cafeteria Riot, and it is a huge
      moment in the LGBTQ+ rights movement. It brought visibility to transgender
      people and the struggles they faced, and the creation of the National
      Transexual Counseling Unit, a peer-run network of social, psychological,
      and medical support – the first of its kind in the world. The Compoton’s
      Cafeteria Riot is also the first-known collective forceful queer response
      to police harassment in American history, certainly an inspiration for the
      later Stonewall Riots.
      <br /><br />
      There was a political backlash against LGBTQ+ people in general in the
      last 1970s, and the AIDS crisis that began in the early 1980s also
      undermined queer rights efforts. It also served to functionally erase
      large segments of the queer population, including our transgender family.
      But as you can see, trans folks have been present and fighting for their
      rights and the dignity they deserve for a long time. And this is why we
      have Pride: to be visible, to be seen, and to be proud of who we are.

      June 6 - Willem Arondéus burns nazi records to protect Dutch Jews
    </h2>
    <div>
      <strong>BE GAY! DO CRIME!</strong>
      <br /><br />
      It’s an internet meme, but it’s also true. Being homosexual is illegal in
      <strong><em>sixty-four countries</em></strong
      >. Our mere existence as gay people is illegal. This meme rings especially
      loudly during Pride month, then, when simply by being, we are committing a
      crime – but we won’t be stopped from being. <br /><br />
      Willem Arondéus took this call to doing crime especially seriously.
      Arondéus was an openly gay man living in the Netherlands when nazis
      invaded and occupied the country. He joined an anti-nazi resistance
      organization, and became a forger to help hide the identities of Dutch
      Jews from the nazis who were looking for them. Unfortunately, the nazis
      were meticulous records-keepers, so they were soon able to identify the
      forgeries. Arondéus and others in the resistance then carried out a daring
      plan: they bombed the nazi records office. In the process, they destroyed
      around 800,000 identity cards.
      <br /><br />
      Sadly, a few days latter, Arondéus was arrested by the nazi occupiers. A
      month later, he and 13 other men were convicted of the bombing. Arondéus
      took full responsibility, possibly sparing the lives of some of the other
      conspirators. Before he was executed, he is quoted as saying, “Tell people
      that homosexuals are not cowards.” He was gay, and he did a righteous
      crime.
      <br /><br />
      Pride is about that: being queer and fighting for justice. Sometimes the
      cause of justice does not align with the letter of the law, and the only
      way to justice is through crime. When that happens, be gay! Do crime!

    <h2 id="june-7">June 7 - The US Navy searches for Dorothy</h2>
    <div>
      It was illegal to be gay in the military until 1994, when the “Don’t Ask,
      Don’t Tell” policy allowed <em>closeted</em> homosexuals to serve,
      provided they didn’t come out during their service. But before that, being
      gay at all was illegal. The mere suspicion of homosexuality was enough to
      get someone discharged from the military; confirming that you were gay
      could land you in prison. With that historical footnote in mind, it’s no
      surprise that the military branches occasionally launched investigations
      to find and punish gay service members. <br /><br />
      In the early 1980s, the US Navy had turned its sights on gay sailors in
      Chicago. They discovered that gay men sometimes referred to themselves as
      friends of Dorothy. Dorothy, they reasoned, was the center of the gay
      community. If they could find Dorothy, she might lead them to all the gay
      sailors. And so, they launched an enormous hunt for Dorothy. Despite all
      their efforts, however, they never found her.
      <br /><br />
      “Friend of Dorothy” is, indeed, slang for a gay man, but it’s not about
      Dorothy, the head of some imaginary queer cartel. It’s a reference to
      Dorothy Gale from the movie <em>Wizard of Oz</em>. In the movie, Dorothy
      quickly befriends the effeminate Cowardly Lion. Gay men latched on to that
      friendship and adopted it as their own. The Navy... did not know that.

    <h2 id="june-8">June 8 - Perry Watkins serves with pride and honor</h2>
    <div>
      Remember how it used to be illegal to be gay in the military? Up until
      1994, just <em>being</em> gay was illegal. But that’s unjust, and
      sometimes injustice must be met with… crime. Enter Perry Watkins. Watkins
      was an openly gay Black American man living in Germany as an Army kid. In
      1967, he received draft papers, putting him in a double-bind: refusing the
      draft was illegal, but so was being gay in the military. What was he to
      do? <br /><br />
      He did the honorable thing: he appeared for his examination and induction,
      and both times, he told the staff that he was gay. Watkins wasn’t ashamed
      of who he was, and when he was harassed by other servicemembers, he never
      shied away from a fight. He quickly earned a reputation for his
      willingness to defend himself and others in the service soon stopped
      harassing him.
      <br /><br />
      In 1970, his draft tour concluded, but Watkins had trouble finding a job
      at the time so he re-enlisted. Again, he was open and honest about his
      sexuality, and again he was admitted into the Army. He even sometimes
      performed in drag, including at shows sponsored by the Army! In 1972, he
      was investigated for being homosexual – which seems like a really strange
      investigation to open, given his prior admissions – but the investigators
      concluded that maybe he was lying to get out of service. Which… I mean…
      clearly they didn’t see his record. He volunteered the second time!
      <br /><br />
      In 1974, Watkins re-enlisted <em>again</em>, and again made no secret of
      who he was. In 1975, he was investigated <em>again</em>, but this time the
      Army acknowledged he was gay. His service record, however, was excellent,
      and they decided he should not be disciplined or removed. In 1978,
      <em>another</em> investigation. In 1979, he re-enlisted for the final
      time. His reasoning was that being openly gay was obviously not
      disqualifying, so he’d make the military his career and retire with an
      Army pension. Makes sense to me! <br /><br />
      In 1980, yet another investigation into Watkins’ sexuality led to his
      security clearance being revoked, which prevented him from being promoted.
      He filed a lawsuit, arguing that he’d never hid his sexuality and multiple
      previous investigations had determined that, “my homosexuality is no
      obstacle to my military career.” The Army responded to the lawsuit by
      starting discharge proceedings. The lawsuit wound on, with Watkins winning
      an early victory, but in 1983, an appeals court sided with the Army and he
      was discharged in 1984.
      <br /><br />
      After leaving the Army, Watkins went to work for the Social Security
      Administration, demonstrating a clear interest in public service. But he
      also continued his legal fight against the Army. In 1989, the courts found
      in his favor, declaring that simply being homosexual could not be grounds
      for discrimination as it was a violation of the 14th Amendment’s equal
      protection clause. The White House appealed to the Supreme Court, who
      declined to hear the case, and Watkins was offered reinstatement. Instead,
      he opted for retroactive promotion, pay, full retirement benefits, and an
      honorable discharge.
      <br /><br />
      Watkins was instrumental in clearing the path for other gay men and women
      to serve in the military. Investigations into possible homosexuality,
      absent any claims of misconduct, were no longer allowed. Nobody should be
      forced to live against the law, but I am grateful for the people who’ve
      gone before me and had the guts to do it. Perry Watkins was gay, did
      crime, and won.

    <h2 id="june-9">June 9 - d’Aubigny burns a convent for love</h2>
    <div>
      <strong
        >SPOILER: SWORD-FIGHTING BISEXUAL OPERA SINGER SETS FIRE TO A
        CONVENT</strong
      >
      <br /><br />
      Julie d’Aubigny was born in 1673, before the concept of bisexuality had
      evolved. (The evolution of our understanding of sexuality is pretty
      fascinating, but also pretty recent. Just because we didn’t have language
      to describe it doesn’t mean it didn’t exist, though.) She was given to a
      count in arranged marriage in 1687 at the age of 14. The count was sent to
      southern France by the king, but d’Aubigny stayed in Paris.
      <br /><br />
      That same year, she began a relationship with a fencing instructor named
      Séranne. Due to legal troubles, the pair fled Paris. In the course of
      their flight, d’Aubigny made money by giving fencing exhibitions. She also
      dressed mostly in men’s clothings, though she never claimed to be a man or
      tried to pass as one. She was just a woman who liked men’s clothes.
      S’cool. But anyway, she was a gifted fencer. And when the duo arrived in
      Marseilles, d’Aubigny joined an opera company and began performing. Turns
      out, she was gifted at that too.
      <br /><br />
      A spectator at one of her shows, a young woman, was smitten. The woman’s
      father attempted to hide her from d’Aubigny by sending her to a convent,
      but d’Aubigny would not be deterred from her new love. Instead, she told
      the nuns that she was interested in becoming a nun herself to gain entry
      to the convent. When the time came to escape, she stole a dead nun’s body,
      put it in the other woman’s bed, and then set the room on fire. The chaos
      that followed allowed them to escape unseen. Their love affair was brief,
      however – they split up after 3 months – and d’Aubigny was eventually
      charged with kidnapping, body snatching, and arson.
      <br /><br />
      d’Aubigny moved back to Paris and joined the Paris Opera, where she
      performed for the king multiple times. She continued dressing in men’s
      clothes because that’s what she wanted to do and she was a boss. And when
      someone dared to insult the opera, she challenged them to a duel and won.
      During her time at the Paris opera, she was known to date both men and
      women, as suited her fancy.
      <br /><br />
      I don’t know how much discrimination d’Aubigny faced, but one thing is for
      sure: she was in charge of her own life. “Queer” is a broad term, but it
      certainly includes bisexual people. (Or maybe pansexual? There’s no way to
      know how she would have identified since the language simply didn’t exist
      yet.) But it also includes people who eschew gender norms and expectations
      in favor of what brings them joy, like a woman wearing pants or sword
      fighting. Not everyone who is gay and does crime does it for justice, but
      we celebrate their individuality just the same.

    <h2 id="june-12">June 12 - Anna Genovese provides mob protection</h2>
    <div>
      <strong>“Be gay, do crime”</strong> isn’t just a meme, as you know. It’s a
      lived reality when your existence is criminal. And a funny thing about
      criminals is they tend to band together for mutual protection. Enter Anna
      Genovese.
      <br />
      Genovese was an Italian-American woman born into a mafia family. She
      married Vito Genovese in 1932, and when Vito had to flee the country
      because he was wanted for murder in 1937, the family business fell to
      Anna. With prohibition repealed a few years earlier, the mob bar business
      wasn’t as strong as it had been, and Genovese needed a new way to attract
      customers and their money.
      <br />
      Around this same time, police began harassment of queer people, including
      raiding bars that were suspected of serving or catering to homosexuals.
      Fending off police raids is something mafia bar owners knew how to do, so
      Genovese decided to operate gay bars. Effectively, she created a place for
      queer folks to safely be themselves. Her bars hosted drag performances,
      both drag kings and drag queens, and attracted lots of queer patrons who
      could relax and be themselves for a while.
      <br />
      And it turns out, she wasn’t simply extorting an oppressed minority.
      Genovese left Vito in 1951, and was soon striking up romances with others,
      including a drag queen (a woman who performs masculinity). Anna Genovese
      was likely bisexual, as attested by those who knew her at the time.
      <br />
      Anna Genovese wasn’t the only person in the mafia running queer bars. The
      fact that the gay bars were a frequent target for police raids made them
      naturally interesting for the mafia – pay off the cops, run your “illicit”
      business, make a bunch of money from the people who believe you’ll keep
      them safe in exchange for their cash. The Stonewall Inn was owned by one
      of Anna’s cousins, “Fat Tony” Genovese, even. The relationship between
      organized crime and queer existence and open expression is long, out of an
      unfortunate necessity. As the saying goes, “When you outlaw being queer,
      all the outlaws are queer.” Or something like that, anyway.

    <h2 id="june-13">June 13 - d’Éon does <em>everything</em></h2>
    <div>
      Born to poor nobility (so not rich, but still privileged) in 1728,
      Charles-Geneviève-Louis-Auguste- André-Timothée d’Éon de Beaumont –
      generally simplified to just d’Éon – led quite a life. d’Éon first rose to
      prominence for their writings on financial and administrative systems in
      their 20s. That attracted the attention of the government, and they soon
      found themselves with a royal appointment. <br /><br />
      In 1756, just 28 years old, d’Éon was appointed to the king’s secret
      network of spies. This network was so secret that the department of state
      didn’t even know about them. d’Éon was dispatched to Russia to seek
      Empress Elizabeth’s support in France’s ongoing war with England. The
      English were concerned about such a plot, so they guarded the border with
      Russia and only allowed women and children to enter the country. No
      problem if you’re d’Éon, who had naturally androgynous physical
      characteristics. They simply passed as a woman to enter the court. d’Éon
      lived fully as a woman until they returned to France in 1760.
      <br /><br />
      War with England still raged, so d’Éon joined up as a dragoon and went to
      fight towards the end of the Seven Years’ War. For their service on the
      battle d’Éon was made a chevalier (“knight”), and they were then tapped to
      help write the treaty to end the war. Peace “achieved,” d’Éon was sent to
      London as an interim ambassador. But they were a spy, so why not do some
      light spying while you’re there?! And they did, getting in good with
      British nobility and learning everything they could to help the French
      prepare to invade England.
      <br /><br />
      But in 1763, the permanent ambassador arrived and tried to make a fool of
      d’Éon. The government summoned them home, but they refused to go. d’Éon
      was being used as a political pawn and wanted no part of it. So to get the
      government’s attention, d’Éon published much of the secret diplomatic work
      they had carried out, embarrassing the French government and bringing them
      fame across Europe. But d’Éon held back information about the planned
      invasion to use as leverage against the king and government.
      <br /><br />
      d’Éon was safe from further government harassment and had secured a
      pension, but they were forbidden from returning to France. They lived in
      exile in London until the king died in 1774. The new king disbanded the
      secret spy network, prompting d’Éon to seek permission to go home, which
      they eventually received, along with an important concession: the king and
      French government agreed to recognize d’Éon as a woman.
      <br /><br />
      Now that seems a little out of left field, but d’Éon had claimed to be a
      woman, raised as a boy to guarantee their father’s inheritance. And d’Éon
      was physically androgynous. d’Éon was so well known and questions of their
      gender so high-profile that the London Stock Exchange even had a betting
      market about it. Like taking bets on a gender reveal party – is d’Éon a
      raging wildfire or a fight at Applebee’s? (That’s the two options, right?)
      <br /><br />
      Anyway, d’Éon was back in France and now
      Charlotte-Geneviève-Louise-Augusta-Andréa-Timothéa d’Éon de Beaumont. And
      that’s basically where their story ends, but not because they stopped
      trying to be amazing. d’Éon attempted to join French forces in assisting
      American colonists in the war for independence from Britain, but the
      French wouldn’t allow a woman to fight. Then in 1792, d’Éon offered to
      build an army of female soldiers to do battle against the Habsburgs, but
      they were told no. In fact, being recognized as a woman was enough to
      sideline as a skilled diplomat and spy who hadn’t been stopped by anything
      else.
      <br /><br />
      Today’s story is about someone being themselves and being willing to hold
      a king hostage to do it. It’s also about sexism and the intersections of
      discrimination people face. None of us are one thing, after all. For
      Pride, we put kings on notice – we won’t be stopped – and we continue the

      June 14 - Josephine Baker blows their minds and steals their secrets
    </h2>
    <div>
      Josephine Baker. What a star. The American-born French entertainer was the
      first Black woman to star in a major movie, she was the top-headliner at
      the famed Folies Bergère in Paris, was the iconic fashionista of the Jazz
      Age, spy, civil rights activist, and bisexual. <br /><br />
      Baker was celebrated in her own time, sometimes called the most beautiful
      woman in the world, but always called talented. Her career began at around
      age 13 in New York during the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s. She began
      in the chorus line, but she ad-libbed a bit of the performance to draw
      attention to herself. In 1925, she moved to Paris and starred in a show
      soon after, becoming an instant success. She embraced erotic dancing and
      wasn’t afraid to show a little skin. Sometimes she performed with her pet
      cheetah – yeah, an actual cheetah – and it frequently escaped and
      terrorized the orchestra. The audience loved it.
      <br /><br />
      Baker toured Europe with her star on the rise. Her musical skill was
      beyond question, and her film appearances were always crowd favorites. Her
      physical humor and comedic timing made audiences love her.
      <br /><br />
      In 1939, the world changed with the outbreak of war in Europe. Germany
      invaded Poland prompting a cascade of war declarations, including Baker’s
      now-home France. She joined a French spy agency, using her European
      stardom to rub elbows with German bigwigs all over the continent as she
      performed. After France fell, Baker left Paris but continued her work in
      subterfuge. She found out the locations of troop musters, airfields, and
      more, passing that information along to the English who were busy planning
      for the liberation of Europe.
      <br /><br />
      In 1941, she toured French territories in North Africa, ostensibly “for
      her health” but in reality because that was fertile ground for
      intelligence gathering. She’d make notes of what she learned and tuck them
      in her underwear, hoping the Germans wouldn’t give her the mandatory strip
      search because she was a star. During her stay in Africa, however, she
      struggled to recover from complications of a miscarriage, but once she was
      back on her feet, she created a troupe to entertain Allied soldiers in the
      region.
      <br /><br />
      After the war, Baker’s stardom jumped to a whole new level. Her spying
      activity was well-known, and it freed her to take on riskier and more
      serious projects. In 1951, she was invited back to the United States to
      play a nightclub in Miami, but she refused to play unless the audience
      would be integrated. And her starpower was too much to ignore. The club
      relented and every performance she gave was sold out. She followed with a
      national tour to rave reviews. She similarly criticized the Stork Club for
      its segregationist policies, but unfortunately this time, the political
      machine turned against her and accused her of being a communist, a pretty
      serious allegation in 1950s America. She went home to France.
      <br /><br />
      But her refusal to bend to discrimination wasn’t unrecognized. The NAACP
      declared Sunday, May 20, 1951 to be “Josephine Baker Day.” Baker joined
      the fight to save Willie McGee, a Black man dubiously-convicted of a
      crime, from death. She spoke alongside Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.,
      at the March on Washington. She had this to say:

      <blockquote>
        I have walked into the palaces of kings and queens and into the houses
        of presidents. And much more. But I could not walk into a hotel in
        America and get a cup of coffee, and that made me mad. And when I get
        mad, you know that I open my big mouth. And then look out, ’cause when
        Josephine opens her mouth, they hear it all over the world.
      </blockquote>

      Baker was married four times in her life, and between those marriages, she
      also had numerous relationships with other men and women, including,
      allegedly, famed painter Frida Kahlo.
      <br /><br />
      Is her sexuality a footnote? Well, I mean, kinda. But that’s the point.
      None of us are just one thing, and in an ideal world, the intrinsic
      characteristics of who we are should be unremarkable. But also kinda not a
      footnote. For a bisexual Black woman to become so prominent is surely an
      accomplishment, not because of her intrinsic being but in spite of the
      discrimination she faced because of it.
      <br /><br />
      Pride is all-encompassing. Whoever you are, you’re valid and good. We
      exist at all kinds of identity intersections, and they should all be
      celebrated. And we should fight for equality and dignity along all those
      axes of identity, because none of us are free until all of us are free.

    <h2 id="june-15">June 15 - Frank Kameny challenges the system</h2>
    <div>
      Do you know about the Lavender Scare? Just to recap in case you don’t,
      alongside the anti-communist McCarthyism of the 1950s, there was a
      parallel moral panic about homosexuality, particularly within the federal
      government. One shortsighted argument against queer people in government
      service was that, due to the public stigma of homosexuality, homosexual
      people could be more easily blackmailed to subvert the United States. It’s
      a self-reinforcing belief, but also wrong. <br /><br />
      Anyway, under the Eisenhower White House, new policies were developed in
      1947 to effectively bar homosexuals from federal service, and many gay and
      lesbian federal employees were rooted out and fired. This was the Lavender
      Scare. But not everyone was scared…
      <br /><br />
      Frank Kameny served in the US Army during WWII, and following the war, he
      turned to public service, first in academia and later as a federal civil
      servant in the US Army Map Service. In 1957, at a bus stop in San
      Francisco, Kameny allowed himself to be touched in a sexual way by another
      man. Police were watching the station and promptly arrested Kameny.
      Shortly thereafter, he was fired from the Army Map Service, and in 1958 he
      was barred from federal service for life.
      <br /><br />
      Kameny wasn’t going to take it lying down, however, and appealed his
      firing, ultimately pursuing a lawsuit. This was the first civil rights
      claim based on sexual orientation brought before a US court. In the end
      Kameny’s lawsuit was unsuccessful, but it was critical groundwork for the
      fight to come. That was also the end of Kameny’s paid career, as he spent
      the rest of his life dedicated to civil rights activism, financially
      supported by his friends and family.
      <br /><br />
      In 1963, he drafted legislation to overturn DC’s sodomy laws – a bill that
      was eventually passed in 1993. He cofounded the Annual Reminder in 1965,
      an early precursor to modern Pride. And he rejected the notion that
      homosexuals should adopt heteronormative behaviors in order to be
      accepted, arguing that nobody should be expected to change who they are:
      <blockquote>
        We are interested in obtaining rights for our respective minorities, AS
        Negroes, AS Jews, and AS HOMOSEXUALSS. Why we are Negros, Jews, or
        Homosexuals is totally irrelevant, and whether we can be changed to
        Whites, Christians, or heterosexuals is equally irrelevant.
      </blockquote>
      In 1972, Kameny lobbied the American Psychiatric Association (APA) to
      question whether psychiatry was doing good or harm to the queer community.
      They asked several gay psychiatrists, but only Dr. John E. Fryer was
      willing to facilitate the conversation; he demanded that he be allowed to
      do it in disguise for fear of backlash, though. His testimony and the
      ensuing debate led the APA to remove homosexuality from the Diagnostic and
      Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) in 1973, formally rejecting
      the idea that homosexuality was a disorder.
      <br /><br />
      Throughout the 1970s, Kameny worked with military service members to fight
      dishonorable discharges for their sexuality, winning victories in court
      and earning the public support of the Washington Post, which noted that
      the men being punished:

      <blockquote>
        “[were] involved in no scandal and had brought no shame on the Marine
        Corps”
      </blockquote>

      So there you go. He fought employment discrimination in the federal civil
      service, discrimination in the military, and in healthcare. Kameny was
      instrumental in much of the groundwork for the modern LGBTQ+ rights
      movement. When faced with discrimination, Kameny came out swinging and
      changed the world. Pride. He had it.

    <h2 id="june-16">June 16 - Sylvia Rivera is her own boss</h2>
    <div>
      Sylvia Rivera was a drag queen in New York. She was raised as a boy but
      her effeminate nature was rejected by her family and she left home at the
      age of 10, living instead on the streets. To survive, she turned to
      survival sex work, and was soon taken into the protection of local drag
      queens, including Marsha P. Johnson with whom she found a lifelong
      friendship. <br /><br />
      In 1970, Rivera and Johnson co-founded the Street Transvestite Action
      Revolutionaries (STAR), advocating for homeless queer youth, especially
      those who turned to sex work. In addition to advocacy, the group also
      provided housing.
      <br /><br />
      Rivera referred to herself as both a drag queen and a transvestite at this
      time, showing a fluidity about her identity, sometimes identifying as a
      man in a dress and other times calling herself a woman. (Later in life,
      she identified strictly as a woman, hence the “she” pronouns in this
      post.) But because she didn’t fit social gender norms, she faced
      harassment. It was common through the 1960s and 1970s for people to be
      arrested for wearing the “wrong” gender’s clothes, and as you can imagine,
      that meant Rivera got arrested.
      <br /><br />
      Police brutality towards queer people was well-known, and being Latina
      made her even more vulnerable. On one occasion, Rivera escaped arrest by
      leaping from a moving police car.
      <br /><br />
      Rivera was an adamant proponent of making the LGBTQ+ rights movement more
      inclusive, specifically advocating for drag queens, transvestites (which
      in her later speeches would include transgender people, a term which
      wasn’t widely used in the 70s), the homeless, people of color, and sex
      workers. She believed that we all shared the same fight, and we can be
      most effective at securing our rights if we work together.
      <br /><br />
      The closet is a place people retreat to when they are afraid that their
      identity could get them harmed, but Rivera never bothered with the closet.
      She was unashamed and loved herself; she even began wearing makeup to
      school in 4th grade! And her life demonstrated her belief that
      <em>everyone</em>
      should be able to love themselves and live with dignity. Pride is a
      celebration of who we are and our collective march towards greater
      equality, dignity, and respect, and Sylvia Rivera exemplifies that.

    <h2 id="june-20">June 20 - The rainbow flag evolves</h2>
    <div>
      <img alt="rainbow flag" src="/assets/pride-images/image12.png" />Rainbow
      flag. It's nearly universally understood today to represent LGBTQ+ Pride,
      but it's a pretty obvious design, it's been used in flags since at least
      the 1500s, and has represented causes of liberty, peace, and cooperation.
      How did it become the de facto symbol of the fight for LGBTQ+ rights and
      equality? <br /><br />
      After WWII, LGBTQ+ activists adopted the
      <img alt="pink triangle" src="/assets/pride-images/image15.png" /> pink
      triangle as a symbol for their cause. The nazis had forced gay men to wear
      the pink triangle in prison and concentration camps, and after the war,
      people decided to reclaim the symbol for their own use. In 1978, Gilbert
      Baker designed a new flag for the community to use, to replace the symbol
      born (and reclaimed from) hate. He was inspired by the rainbow's common
      usage in the earlier hippie movement of "peace and love," and together
      with artist Lynn Segerblom, they created the first rainbow pride flag.
      <br /><br />
      That flag had 8 colored stripes, with each color assigned a meaning:
      <ul>
        <li>Hot pink for "sex"</li>
        <li>Red for "life"</li>
        <li>Orange for "healing"</li>
        <li>Yellow for "sunlight"</li>
        <li>Green for "nature"</li>
        <li>Turquoise for "magic"</li>
        <li>Indigo for "serenity"</li>
        <li>Violet for "spirit"</li>
      </ul>
      The new pride flag was first flown at San Francisco's 1978 Gay Freedom Day
      Parade. Later that year, gay lawmaker Harvey Milk was assassinated, and
      demand for the new flag skyrocketed. A local flag maker began producing
      them as quickly as they could, but using stock fabric that only included 7
      colors – no hot pink. (Hot pink didn't return primarily because the fabric
      was just too hard to source.) And in 1979, the turquoise stripe was
      dropped so the flag could be split into two 3-stripe segments to sit on
      opposite sides of light poles.
      <br /><br />
      And that's basically the flag we know today. In 2016, the flag design was
      incorporated as an
      <img alt="pride" src="/assets/pride-images/image5.png" /> emoji, possibly
      marking its ascension into public knowledge and acceptance. But even so
      enshrined in our most important modern glyphs, the flag has continued to
      evolve. For example, in 2017, the Philadelphia Pride Flag introduced black
      and brown stripes to the top of the flag to bring awareness to the
      additional struggles faced by non-white queer people. In 2018, the
      Progress Pride flag was introduced, incorporating the two additional
      stripes of the Philadelphia Pride flag into a chevron alongside the trans
      pride colors to make clear that trans people are part of the LGBTQ+
      community. And in 2021, that Progress Pride flag was modified further to
      include intersex pride. (See below for these three flags!) <br /><br />
      Unlike the pirates on TV, our flag doesn't mean death. Our flag means
      pride. It means community, mutual support, and a willingness to fight for
      ourselves and each other. The more recent evolutions of the flag reinforce
      this by explicitly including more of the LGBTQ+ coalition into the
      symbols.

      June 21 - Colonialism ruins everything (same-sex marriage)
    </h2>
    <div>
      Same-sex marriage is as old as marriage itself. Instances are recorded in
      ancient Egypt, China, Mesopotamia, and continental Europe. The ancient
      Greeks accepted same-sex relations on equal footing with opposite-sex
      relations, and the Roman marital rites were freely given to
      <em>any</em> couple. Nero not only fiddled while Rome burned, but in his
      lifetime, he had at least two husbands. It really wasn't anything anyone
      cared about, but then people got very judgemental and very opinionated
      about right and wrong on the subject, and it became taboo in the western
      world starting around the 300s CE. <br /><br />
      The relationships between same-sex couples didn't stop, of course, but
      they soon had to become more secretive and they lost the protection of the
      state. As European traders made their way to China, they brought their new
      beliefs with them, and as a response to later European colonization, China
      adopted laws against homosexuality on the hope of strengthening their own
      population to repel the invaders. Meanwhile, many African cultures were
      tolerant and accepting of various sexualities and genders, according to
      evidence collected by anthropologists. It wasn't until European
      colonization that attitudes began to shift. Many cultures in the Americas
      similarly accepted homosexual and nonbinary people and their
      relationships, and it was European colonizers who sought to crush this
      aspect (as well as most others) of indigenous American society.
      <br /><br />
      But, things keep turning, and people keep fighting for justice. The first
      same-sex marriage in modern times was in 1971 in Minneapolis. Despite
      being technically illegal, a clerk granted the marriage license and it was
      never annulled or revoked. Their marriage wasn't recognized by the federal
      government, so the couple played shenanigans – one partner legally adopted
      the other and claimed them as a dependent on their taxes. Hey, whatever
      works! During the 1970s, many American LGBTQ+ rights activists believed
      that same-sex marriage was just a few years away from mainstream
      acceptance, but the HIV/AIDS crisis that began in the early 1980s derailed
      the movement.
      <br /><br />
      It wasn't until 2001 that any modern country finally legalized same-sex
      marriages when the Netherlands broadened the legal definition and
      conferred equal rights for all married couples. That kicked off a cascade,
      and today at least 34 countries have followed suit, including the United
      States in 2015. And this year, the Choctaw Nation, Andorra, and Estonia
      all recognized marriage equality. And lots of other nations are
      reconsidering their past stance on the issue as well: Honduras, India,
      Japan, the Navajo Nation, South Korea, and Venezuela, to name a few!
      <br /><br />
      The thing about Pride is that it never ends. It's been a 2,000-year-battle
      to get where we are today – a place that for many parts of the world is
      actually back to where it was before European colonization. And we've
      still got a long way to go, which is why Pride must continue. It's not
      about imposing a worldview or morality on anyone, but rejecting moralities
      and worldviews imposed on us. Fight the power!

    <h2 id="june-22">June 22 - LGBTQ+ people face the AIDS crisis</h2>
    <div>
      HIV likely made the jump from apes to humans in the 1920s. People with
      unusual symptoms were documented as early as the 1950s, and their tissue
      samples were later shown to be infected with HIV. But for the most part,
      the virus and associated illnesses were poorly understood until the 1980s,
      when it exploded around the world.
      <br /><br />
      By 1980, gay men in the United States were aware of some kind of illness
      spreading within their communities. In 1981, the Centers for Disease
      Control published a report about the surprising appearance of uncommon
      diseases among otherwise healthy men in cities across the US, with
      pneumocystis pneumonia and Kaposi’s sarcoma chief among them. In 1982,
      researchers speculated that some as-yet unidentified pathogen was being
      transmitted by sexual activity, and the collection of symptoms was dubbed
      GRID for “gay-related immune deficiency.”
      <br /><br />
      The virus was isolated in 1983, but the damage to the queer community was
      already done. An entire generation of gay men would be decimated, with
      hundreds of thousands dead. And the fact that the virus initially spread
      primarily among gay men was fodder for anti-queer activists who had
      already begun mobilizing to oppose LGBTQ+ rights.
      <br /><br />
      The name GRID was a political disaster for the LGBTQ+ community as a
      whole. The virus was not, in fact, gay-related at all. It did not and does
      not care about a person’s sexual orientation. But anti-queer activists
      latched on to the idea and quickly began calling it “gay plague,” and
      claiming it was their god’s wrath striking down sinners. There wasn’t much
      news coverage or public interest – after all, only “those” people got
      sick. Sex workers, intravenous drug users, gay men? Society didn’t really
      care.
      <br /><br />
      But, as we know, queer people fight back. It was gay community leaders who
      proposed renaming the condition to AIDS, for example. Political leaders
      often didn’t want to engage on the issue, so queer folks brought the
      conversation to their doorsteps, marching and protesting at their offices
      or public events. To gather more attention, the protestors staged
      “die-ins,” modeled on Black civil rights sit-ins, where they would lie
      down in streets, churches, or other high-profile places to symbolize those
      who had died and were dying.
      <br /><br />
      ACT UP was formed in 1987 to be a more active political organization, and
      they didn’t let anyone off the hook. The White House was infamously silent
      about HIV/AIDS, and did little to make resources available for the study,
      prevention, or treatment of the disease. In response. ACT UP took up a
      protest outside the US Federal Drug Administration in 1988, shutting the
      office down entirely while chanting, “Hey, Hey! FDA! How many people have
      you killed today?” Because they effectively shut down a government agency,
      they got a <strong><em>lot</em></strong> of attention, and that led to a
      dramatic increase in funding for HIV/AIDS-related programs. In 1988, the
      Department of Justice reversed an earlier policy and prevented
      discrimination on the basis of HIV diagnosis (later incorporated into law
      in the Americans With Disabilities Act), and the FDA substantially lowered
      the cost of one of the most effective HIV drugs, AZT. <br /><br />
      Public and political perception of HIV/AIDS shifted dramatically due to
      the work of activists and organizations like ACT UP. It was not an easy
      fight, but it was effective. Public funding of research has led us to
      highly effective treatments and even preventative medication. Today,
      people infected with HIV and with access to healthcare can expect to live
      long, healthy lives thanks to new medicines that suppress the virus so
      successfully that it can’t even be transmitted to others (often called
      “undetectable”). This would not be possible without the work of these
      activists and the impressive protests they put on.
      <br /><br />
      HIV/AIDS is no longer a “gay disease,” either in public perception or in
      statistics. The epidemic is still raging and more work is needed to make
      treatment available to everyone. But the hard work of LGBTQ+ activists
      broke open the gates of research funding that have made HIV less of a
      death sentence.
      <br /><br />
      Pride is about demanding justice and equality, not just politically but
      medically too. When it’s denied to any of us, we all suffer, so we must
      fight for everyone. Pride is also about acknowledging our victories.
      HIV/AIDS isn’t solved, but queer activists successfully got the funding
      spigots turned on, which led us directly to modern treatments that work so
      well. We should all be proud of those who fought that fight because they
      brought hope into the world.

    <h2 id="june-23">June 23 - Movies go gay all of a sudden</h2>
    <div>
      You’ve probably heard of or seen some queer movies:
      <em>Brokeback Mountain</em>, <em>Portrait of a Lady on Fire</em>,
      <em>Call Me By Your Name</em>, <em>Tangerine</em>,
      <em>Paris is Burning</em>. There are bunches of them! And LGBTQ+
      characters commonly appear in movies that <em>aren’t</em> about being
      queer, which is nice because it’s just like real life – queer people who
      exist but whose queerness isn’t their defining characteristic. But as
      common as LGBTQ+ have become in film today, it hasn’t always been that
      way. <br /><br />
      Early films didn’t shy away from LGBTQ+ representation. Charlie Chaplin
      played up “sissy” stereotypes when his character was mocked for appearing
      to kiss another man. A 1919 German film told the story of a gay man who
      committed suicide after being blackmailed for his sexuality, advocating
      for more acceptance. In 1930, actress Marlene Dietrich, bisexual herself,
      added a scene to the movie <em>Morocco</em> in which she dresses in a
      man’s tuxedo and kisses a woman in the audience – the first known same-sex
      kiss between women <br /><br />
      Alas, in 1934, Hollywood studios adopted the Hays Code, a strict set of
      rules about what was and wasn’t allowed in film. Positive depictions of
      homosexuality were strictly forbidden. Movies had to go through censors
      before they could be shown to audiences, and censors would eagerly chop
      out scenes that violated the code. As a result, queer representation was
      reduced. But… not eliminated.
      <br /><br />
      In 1938’s <em>Bringing Up Baby</em>, Cary Grant exclaims, “I just went
      <strong><em>gay</em></strong> all of a sudden!” This was the first time in
      film history that the word “gay” was used to mean homosexual, but surely
      that ran afoul of the Hays Code? Well, technically yes, they were able to
      skirt it because “gay” wasn’t well-known slang for a homosexual man yet,
      and they told censors that Grant’s character was referring to being very
      silly. But closeted Hollywood actors used the term to describe themselves,
      and Grant was friends with several gay actors so he knew what he was doing
      when he ad-libbed the line. (Delightful movie, by the way.) <br /><br />
      Queerness was often “coded” into movies with exaggerated stereotypical
      behaviors. <em>Rebel Without a Cause</em> featuring James Dean, for
      example, a supporting character, Plato, is coded as gay – the way he looks
      longingly at Dean’s character and the picture of a hunky man in his school
      locker. Censors warned the filmmakers against going too far, which squares
      with a claim that the original script had the two boys sharing a kiss.
      <br /><br />
      It was easier for movies to code <em>villains</em> as queer, since that
      wasn’t a “positive” portrayal of homosexuality. As a result, a lot of film
      villains have played up queer stereotypes and tropes. And you’ve seen many
      of these villains! Disney especially bought into it. Scar from
      <em>The Lion King</em> is strongly queer-coded, for example. And Captain
      Hook from <em>Peter Pan</em>. Jafar from <em>Aladdin</em> is so strongly
      coded that it’s almost ridiculous to call him coded at all. And Ursula
      from <em>The Little Mermaid</em> was inspired by drag queen and subversive
      actor Divine. (Look at the two side by side. You can’t not see it.)
      <br /><br />
      The Hays Code ended in 1968, and films began incorporating openly queer
      characters as heroes again. Most mainstream films continued to code LGBTQ+
      characters, but the doors were open to more explicit representation.
      <em>The Rocky Horror Picture Show</em> embraced queer camp wholeheartedly,
      <em>Paris is Burning</em> showed people what New York’s queer ballroom
      culture was about, and <em>Philadelphia</em> saw Tom Hanks, already an
      A-list celebrity, portray a gay man fighting for his rights. <br /><br />
      By the mid-1990s, queer characters in film no longer had to be villains,
      secondary characters, or tragic figures, and now it’s not unusual to see
      LGBTQ+ characters in movies and TV shows leading the kinds of normal lives
      that <em>real</em> LGBTQ+ people lead. Pride is about persistence in the
      face of oppression. The censors said “no homo” but filmmakers and actors…
      well, let’s just say malicious compliance is technically compliance.<img

      June 26 - Martha P. Johnson doesn’t throw a brick but does fight
    </h2>
    <div>
      Marsha P. Johnson was a major LGBTQ+ rights activist and drag queen in New
      York City. You may have heard that they threw the first brick at the
      Stonewall riots, a nod to Johnson’s importance though inaccurate – Johnson
      wasn’t there when the patrons began fighting back against police
      harassment, and Johnson consistently corrected rumors to the contrary. But
      Johnson <em>did</em> cofound Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries
      (STAR) with Sylvia Rivera, to promote the rights and safety of queer youth
      and sex workers. Many young LGBTQ+ people ended up in “survival
      prostitution” after being cast out by their families, and organizations
      like STAR helped them survive and build their new lives. <br /><br />
      Marsha P. Johnson was more than just an activist, too. They were a
      performer, doing regular drag shows in outfits designed to showcase both
      masculine and feminine at the same time. They modeled for photography,
      most notably a session for Andy Warhol in 1975. They sang with the New
      York City Gay Men’s Chorus. And Johnson was also just plain nice, known as
      “the mayor of Christopher Street” in Greenwich Village because they were
      so welcoming.
      <br /><br />
      But Johnson had to fight discrimination from <em>within</em> the LGBTQ+
      community. As a drag queen, they were not readily accepted as a civil
      rights figure. Many people were afraid that their presence would actually
      hinder the queer rights movement. In fact, Johnson and Rivera were both
      banned from the 1973 Pride parade. In response, the pair held their own
      parade – marching down the street immediately in front of the official
      Pride parade. <br /><br />
      When the HIV/AIDS crisis hit, Johnson – who eventually contracted the
      disease – committed to visiting and sitting with patients in the hospital
      so they wouldn’t have to suffer and die alone. They also joined ACT UP,
      bringing their signature flair to AIDS activism.
      <br /><br />
      Besides being a gifted performer, a welcoming figure in the community, and
      an outspoken advocate for social outcasts, Johnson also had a delightful
      sense of humor. They originally adopted the drag name “Black Marsha” but
      eventually settled on Marsha P. Johnson, taking “Johnson” from the Howard
      Johnson’s restaurant. The P stands for “pay it no mind,” a phrase Johnson
      often used sarcastically when asked about their gender. When asked about
      their name in court, Johnson told the judge exactly what the P stood for,
      which amused the judge and led to Johnson being released.
      <br /><br />
      In the early 1990s, anti-queer violence was peaking in America with
      thousands of anti-LGBTQ+ hate crimes reported around the country,
      including many committed by police. In 1992, Johnson’s body was discovered
      in the Hudson River. Police immediately declared it a suicide, but
      Johnson’s friends denied that. Considering Johnson’s outspoken activism
      and the hate-fueled anti-queer violence permeating New York City at the
      time, homicide seems likely. In 2002, the New York police department
      finally acknowledged that Johnson’s death was unlikely to be suicide, but
      through at least 2016, they still refused to reopen the case and
      investigate.
      <br /><br />
      For Pride today, we reject our predecessors’ bias against drag queens,
      thanks to activists like Marsha P. Johnson. Their welcoming demeanor and
      work with STAR helped young queer people, cut off by their families, find
      safety and stability. Their compassion helped people suffering from
      HIV/AIDS to at least have a friend to accompany them. We celebrate their
      compassion, their humor, their creativity, their courage, and their
      authenticity.

      June 27 - Roberta Cowell rules the skies and the racetrack
    </h2>
    <div>
      Roberta Cowell was born in the United Kingdom in 1918 and was a
      transgender woman. She attended an all-boys public school, where she
      joined the motor club, learning about race cars, engines, and other
      miscellaneous mechanical knowledge. In the early 1930s, she made a school
      trip to Germany where she exercised another hobby, filmmaking, taking
      footage of drills being conducted by nazi soldiers. She was arrested, but
      the nazis let her go when she promised to destroy the film. She did not
      destroy the film, instead destroying a blank roll of film to fool the
      nazis. <br /><br />
      After school at just 16 years old, Cowell got a job as an aircraft
      engineer, and with war looming, she soon joined the Royal Air Force.
      Unfortunately, she suffered from motion sickness, so she was discharged
      from the service. Cowell then turned back to her love of automobiles and
      took up auto racing. In 1936, while studying engineering in college, she
      won a race at Land’s End Speed Trials. And she learned a lot about cars by
      putting on mechanic’s clothes, sneaking into the garages, and offering to
      help anyone who needed it. Within three years, she owned three race cars
      of her own and was a regular competitor.
      <br /><br />
      Eventually the looming war became a present war, and in late 1940, Cowell
      was back in military service, this time in the British army. She served
      outside of the UK for a year before transferring back into the Royal Air
      Force. Here she served on the frontlines in a British Spitfire, and
      narrowly escaped disaster when the oxygen system on her plane conked out
      at 30,000 feet. She passed out, but mercifully the plane continued flying.
      Over enemy territory. Through anti-aircraft fire. Somehow she survived,
      regaining consciousness an hour later as the plane descended, and she was
      able to return home.
      <br /><br />
      In another event, her plane was shot down and she was captured by nazis.
      She didn’t go quietly, though. She attempted to escape twice before they
      even got her back to their camp. She ended up in solitary confinement
      before being transferred to a prisoner of war camp, where she remained
      until liberated by the Soviet army in 1945.
      <br /><br />
      After the war, Cowell returned to racing in events across Europe, but PTSD
      troubled her. After seeing a psychiatrist for a while, she realized that
      she’d aggressively repressed her femininity and would be more comfortable
      embracing and identifying as a woman. She began hormone treatments and
      soon had the first of a pair of “sex change” surgeries. A gynecologist
      declared her intersex, which opened the door for her to get a new birth
      certificate and name change. In 1951, she underwent the second surgery.
      <br /><br />
      The surgeries were illegal in the UK at the time due to anti-LGBTQ+
      bigotry coupled with a poor understanding of gender generally and
      transgender identity in particular. The same attitudes cost Cowell her
      businesses and prevented her from getting jobs. Her primary source of
      income through the mid-1950s was through selling her story – first to a UK
      magazine and then from her autobiography. She did continue her racing
      career, to the extent she was allowed, and continued to win.
      <br /><br />
      When her story landed in the United States, it was a sensation. And
      groundbreaking. At the time, people undergoing gender-affirming surgery
      were closely associated with the taboo of homosexual or effeminate men.
      Cowell shattered both of those views: she was not homosexual, having
      previously been married to a woman and raising children; and she was not
      effeminate, being a World War II ace fighter pilot and an automobile
      racing star.
      <br /><br />
      During Pride, we celebrate people for who they are. Cowell was a race
      car-driving fighter pilot who just needed time to recognize and understand
      their gender identity. She demonstrated that gender does not have to box
      us into – or <strong><em>out of</em></strong> – anything, and in doing so,
      she opened Americans’ eyes to the possibility that people who receiving
      gender-affirming care could possibly be normal people. While she was still
      considered a spectacle in her own time, challenging the misconceptions
      people held about trans people laid important groundwork for a more
      accepting future.

    <h2 id="june-28">June 28 - Category IS… Ballroom realness</h2>
    <div>
      Drag has its roots in the late 19th century, when people would gather in
      private to wear the “wrong” gender’s clothes, in direct defiance of laws
      banning that practice. (In the United States, these laws persisted into
      the 2000s, though courts would immediately throw them out. They were
      actively used to justify police harassment into at least the 1980s.)
      William Dorsey Swann, the first person we know to have called themselves a
      drag queen, had been enslaved, and most of his drag events were filled
      with other formerly enslaved men. White gay men were welcome at his drag
      balls, and soon they began hosting them as well. Despite being integrated
      balls, there was still a bright streak of racism: all of the judges were
      white and only white performers won awards. This persisted until the
      1960s, when Latino and Black attendees grew fed up and started their
      <em>own</em> balls. <br /><br />
      Thus, modern Ballroom culture was born in Harlem. The new Ballroom culture
      was meant to be inclusive of all LGBTQ+ people, explicitly embracing and
      celebrating those who faced discrimination within the larger LGBTQ+
      community at the time. Ballroom was one of the few places that transgender
      people, especially transgender people of color, could safely be themselves
      in a welcoming community. To support this diversity, Balls often had
      competitions in a very wide range of categories so everyone in the
      community could find a niche to compete in.
      <br /><br />
      In the 1980s, voguing developed in the Ballroom, a highly stylized form of
      dance where the body is used to create symmetrical shapes and forms with
      graceful movement between distinct poses. It further evolved into “new way
      vogue,” which deemphasized holding poses in favor of more continuous
      movement, rapidly “snapping” between poses and demonstrating more
      flexibility than the straight lines of “old way.” Voguing takes its name
      from <em>Vogue</em> magazine whose cover model poses were an inspiration
      to dancers. It reached mainstream audiences when Madonna released her song
      <em>Vogue</em> in 1990, drawing on her experience attending and watching
      Ballroom performances. <br /><br />
      And Ballroom continues today! Balls are hosted regularly and around the
      world. The influence and legacy of Ballroom has made its way throughout
      queer culture, and has even seeped into mainstream entertainment, with
      shows like <em>RuPaul’s Drag Race</em> finding major success with
      traditional Ballroom categories and performance styles. The language of
      Ballroom has also broken out into wider usage with terms like “shade,”
      “werk,” and “fierce” entering the common parlance. <br /><br />
      Pride celebrates all aspects of all LGBTQ+ people, and especially
      highlights those who have fought against intersectional injustice, such as
      being queer and a racial minority. Ballroom is that: Black and Latino
      LGBTQ+ people fighting back against racism and homophobia, making their
      own space, and winning more acceptance for themselves – and all of us – in
      the process.

    <h2 id="june-29">June 29 - Lil Nas X comes in on a horse</h2>
    <div>
      Hip-hop was born in the late 1970s in the Bronx, in response to and
      influenced by the popularity of disco. Disco was, in many ways, a revival
      of energetic dance halls, and quite often discotheques were open to
      everyone – explicitly included people who’d been excluded previously:
      Black, Hispanic, Latino, and LGBTQ+. As a result, early hip-hop had close
      ties to the queer community.
      <br /><br />
      Many hip-hop and rap artists soon adopted toxic masculinity in their
      lyrics, however, which also meant homophobic language. Even today, some
      use homophobic language in their music despite expressing allyship
      elsewhere. That said, since at least the early 1990s, hip-hop and rap had
      become large and diverse genres, including many openly LGBTQ+ artists.
      Meshell Ndegeocello, an openly bisexual Black woman, for example,
      discussed sexuality and the intersectionality of sexuality and Blackness
      in America. And that’s really no surprise; rap and hip-hop had been
      confronting social justice issues since almost day one.
      <br /><br />
      Frank Ocean made a big splash when he publicly came out in 2012, becoming
      the first mainstream successful Black gay male hip-hop artist. In late
      2018, a relatively unknown artist named Lil Nas X released a country/rap
      song titled <em>Old Town Road</em>, and it blew up. First it went viral as
      the soundtrack for a TikTok trend (largely because of serious work Lil Nas
      X put into promoting it). It reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100
      chart, and debuted at #19 on the country chart and #36 on the R&B/hip-hop
      chart. The song set the record for most streams of a single song in a
      week, with over 140 million listens. By late August, the song had over a
      billion listens on Spotify alone. <br /><br />
      On the last day of Pride in 2019, Lil Nas X tweeted to the world that he
      is gay. In 2021, he released the song and accompanying music video for
      <em>Montero</em>. The lyrics are pretty gay, but the music video is just
      an outright queer festival: homosexuality on full display, high drag,
      gender-bending, and a shot across the bow of those who claim being LGBTQ+
      is immoral. This kind of emotional explosion is not uncommon with coming
      out. It’s normal for all the feelings that had been locked inside the
      closet to come pouring out when the doors first open, and those emotions
      can include a lot of anger – for the time lost to hiding, for the
      self-loathing, and for the people who made you feel unsafe. <br /><br />
      Anyway, Lil Nas X has never shied away from his identity since then, using
      his music to explore more of his experience growing up in the closet and
      coming to terms with his sexuality. He’s also never backed down from
      people who criticize him for being gay or for his artistic expression,
      instead embracing, extending, and inventing memes meant to validate LGBTQ+
      identities in the face of attempted oppression. And in 2023, after more
      introspection – and with the freedom to explore himself – he came out as
      “a little bit bisexual.”
      <br /><br />
      At Pride, we celebrate the younger generations continuing the fight for
      justice, equality, and respect. The work of generations past have made it
      safer and more acceptable to be openly queer, and today’s younger
      generations are taking that and building on top of it to make the world
      more inclusive and just. Lil Nas X wasn’t the first openly gay Black male
      hip-hop/rap artist, and because of the way he uses his stardom, he won’t
      be the last. For Pride, we celebrate those who came before, those who are
      here now, and those who are coming next.

      I had a final feel-good message prepared for the last day of Pride, but
      not anymore. Today the Supreme Court ruled that LGBTQ+ people do not
      deserve protection in the public sphere. The question at hand was simply
      this: can a business discriminate against someone based on their inherent
      being, if that business has a “deeply-held belief” that those people are
      immoral. The Supreme Court said yes, the business can discriminate. It is
      just a breath away from overturning major provisions of the 1964 Civil
      Rights Act. If businesses can refuse service to queer people because they
      believe queer people are immoral, what’s stopping businesses from making
      the same argument about people of color? Women? Muslims? Etc. It’s a very
      slippery slope.

      Pride is the unending fight against injustice and intolerance. And
      injustice persists, even literally to this day. This very morning. This
      very hour. I can’t end Pride month on a happy note when the powers that be
      have decided injustice shall be the order of the day. We all deserve
      respect, dignity, and justice. Every one of us. Pride is for us all. June
      may be designated LGBTQ+ Pride month, but the fight – the crimes people
      have had to commit simply for being themselves – is shared across all
      human experiences.
