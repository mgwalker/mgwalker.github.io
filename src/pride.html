  I wrote these in June 2023 and posted them in my work Slack each working day
  of the month. Rather than leave them locked in Slack forever, I wanted to keep
  them for myself, becuase frankly, I'm proud of the work I put into them, and
  if other people can learn as much from them as I learned from writing them,
  then putting them online is a good idea!

    >In the mid-1960s, transgender women teamed up with drag queens in San
    Francisco&rsquo;s Tenderloin district to form a social and political
    organization to advocate for their rights and needs. They met at

    generally used the location solely as a meeting spot and never bought

    not prepared to be met with force in response. The activists hit police with
    their purses and high-heeled shoes, as well as threw sugar shakers and other
    tableware at them. When police retreated into the streets to call for

    medical support &ndash; the first of its kind in the world. The

    Arond&eacute;us was an openly gay man living in the Netherlands when nazis
    invaded and occupied the country. He joined an anti-nazi resistance
    organization, and became a forger to help hide the identities of Dutch Jews
    from the nazis who were looking for them. Unfortunately, the nazis were
    meticulous records-keepers, so they were soon able to identify the
    forgeries. Arond&eacute;us and others in the resistance then carried out a
    daring plan: they bombed the nazi records office. In the process, they
    destroyed around 800,000 identity cards.</span

    occupiers. A month later, he and 13 other men were convicted of the bombing.
    Arond&eacute;us took full responsibility, possibly sparing the lives of some
    of the other conspirators. Before he was executed, he is quoted as saying,
    &ldquo;Tell people that homosexuals are not cowards.&rdquo; He was gay, and

    must be met with&hellip; crime. Enter Perry Watkins. Watkins was an openly
    gay Black American man living in Germany as an Army kid. In 1967, he
    received draft papers, putting him in a double-bind: refusing the draft was
    illegal, but so was being gay in the military. What was he to do?</span

    ashamed of who he was, and when he was harassed by other servicemembers, he
    never shied away from a fight. He quickly earned a reputation for his

    performed in drag, including at shows sponsored by the Army! In 1972, he was
    investigated for being homosexual &ndash; which seems like a really strange
    investigation to open, given his prior admissions &ndash; but the
    investigators concluded that maybe he was lying to get out of service.
    Which&hellip; I mean&hellip; clearly they didn&rsquo;t see his record. He
    volunteered the second time!</span

    security clearance being revoked, which prevented him from being promoted.
    He filed a lawsuit, arguing that he&rsquo;d never hid his sexuality and
    multiple previous investigations had determined that, &ldquo;my
    homosexuality is no obstacle to my military career.&rdquo; The Army
    responded to the lawsuit by starting discharge proceedings. The lawsuit
    wound on, with Watkins winning an early victory, but in 1983, an appeals
    court sided with the Army and he was discharged in 1984.</span

    Administration, demonstrating a clear interest in public service. But he
    also continued his legal fight against the Army. In 1989, the courts found
    in his favor, declaring that simply being homosexual could not be grounds
    for discrimination as it was a violation of the 14th Amendment&rsquo;s equal
    protection clause. The White House appealed to the Supreme Court, who
    declined to hear the case, and Watkins was offered reinstatement. Instead,
    he opted for retroactive promotion, pay, full retirement benefits, and an
    honorable discharge.</span

    any claims of misconduct, were no longer allowed. Nobody should be forced to
    live against the law, but I am grateful for the people who&rsquo;ve gone
    before me and had the guts to do it. Perry Watkins was gay, did crime, and

    >Genovese was an Italian-American woman born into a mafia family. She
    married Vito Genovese in 1932, and when Vito had to flee the country because
    he was wanted for murder in 1937, the family business fell to Anna. With
    prohibition repealed a few years earlier, the mob bar business wasn&rsquo;t
    as strong as it had been, and Genovese needed a new way to attract customers
    and their money.</span

<p class="c31 c34">
  <span class="c4 c0"
    >Around this same time, police began harassment of queer people, including
    raiding bars that were suspected of serving or catering to homosexuals.
    Fending off police raids is something mafia bar owners knew how to do, so
    Genovese decided to operate gay bars. Effectively, she created a place for
    queer folks to safely be themselves. Her bars hosted drag performances, both
    drag kings and drag queens, and attracted lots of queer patrons who could
    relax and be themselves for a while.</span

<p class="c31 c34 c22"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p>
<p class="c31 c34">
  <span class="c4 c0"
    >And it turns out, she wasn&rsquo;t simply extorting an oppressed minority.
    Genovese left Vito in 1951, and was soon striking up romances with others,
    including a drag queen (a woman who performs masculinity). Anna Genovese was
    likely bisexual, as attested by those who knew her at the time.</span

<p class="c31 c34">
  <span class="c0"
    >Anna Genovese wasn&rsquo;t the only person in the mafia running queer bars.
    The fact that the gay bars were a frequent target for police raids made them
    naturally interesting for the mafia &ndash; pay off the cops, run your
    &ldquo;illicit&rdquo; business, make a bunch of money from the people who
    believe you&rsquo;ll keep them safe in exchange for their cash. The
    Stonewall Inn was owned by one of Anna&rsquo;s cousins, &ldquo;Fat
    Tony&rdquo; Genovese, even. The relationship between organized crime and
    queer existence and open expression is long, out of an unfortunate
    necessity. As the saying goes, &ldquo;When you outlaw being queer, all the
    outlaws are queer.&rdquo; Or something like that, anyway. </span

<p class="c40 c36">

    >Born to poor nobility (so not rich, but still privileged) in 1728,
    Charles-Genevi&egrave;ve-Louis-Auguste- Andr&eacute;-Timoth&eacute;e
    d&rsquo;&Eacute;on de Beaumont &ndash; generally simplified to just
    d&rsquo;&Eacute;on &ndash; led quite a life. d&rsquo;&Eacute;on first rose
    to prominence for their writings on financial and administrative systems in
    their 20s. That attracted the attention of the government, and they soon
    found themselves with a royal appointment.</span

<p class="c31 c36">
  <span class="c4 c0"
    >In 1756, just 28 years old, d&rsquo;&Eacute;on was appointed to the
    king&rsquo;s secret network of spies. This network was so secret that the
    department of state didn&rsquo;t even know about them. d&rsquo;&Eacute;on
    was dispatched to Russia to seek Empress Elizabeth&rsquo;s support in
    France&rsquo;s ongoing war with England. The English were concerned about
    such a plot, so they guarded the border with Russia and only allowed women
    and children to enter the country. No problem if you&rsquo;re
    d&rsquo;&Eacute;on, who had naturally androgynous physical characteristics.
    They simply passed as a woman to enter the court. d&rsquo;&Eacute;on lived
    fully as a woman until they returned to France in 1760.</span

<p class="c31 c36 c22"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p>
<p class="c31 c36">
  <span class="c4 c0"
    >War with England still raged, so d&rsquo;&Eacute;on joined up as a dragoon
    and went to fight towards the end of the Seven Years&rsquo; War. For their
    service on the battle d&rsquo;&Eacute;on was made a chevalier
    (&ldquo;knight&rdquo;), and they were then tapped to help write the treaty
    to end the war. Peace &ldquo;achieved,&rdquo; d&rsquo;&Eacute;on was sent to
    London as an interim ambassador. But they were a spy, so why not do some
    light spying while you&rsquo;re there?! And they did, getting in good with
    British nobility and learning everything they could to help the French
    prepare to invade England.</span

</p>
<p class="c31 c36 c22"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p>
<p class="c31 c36">
  <span class="c4 c0"
    >But in 1763, the permanent ambassador arrived and tried to make a fool of
    d&rsquo;&Eacute;on. The government summoned them home, but they refused to
    go. d&rsquo;&Eacute;on was being used as a political pawn and wanted no part
    of it. So to get the government&rsquo;s attention, d&rsquo;&Eacute;on
    published much of the secret diplomatic work they had carried out,
    embarrassing the French government and bringing them fame across Europe. But
    d&rsquo;&Eacute;on held back information about the planned invasion to use
    as leverage against the king and government.</span

<p class="c31 c36">
  <span class="c4 c0"
    >d&rsquo;&Eacute;on was safe from further government harassment and had
    secured a pension, but they were forbidden from returning to France. They
    lived in exile in London until the king died in 1774. The new king disbanded
    the secret spy network, prompting d&rsquo;&Eacute;on to seek permission to
    go home, which they eventually received, along with an important concession:
    the king and French government agreed to recognize d&rsquo;&Eacute;on as a
    woman.</span

<p class="c31 c36 c22"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p>
<p class="c31 c36">
  <span class="c4 c0"
    >Now that seems a little out of left field, but d&rsquo;&Eacute;on had
    claimed to be a woman, raised as a boy to guarantee their father&rsquo;s
    inheritance. And d&rsquo;&Eacute;on was physically androgynous.
    d&rsquo;&Eacute;on was so well known and questions of their gender so
    high-profile that the London Stock Exchange even had a betting market about
    it. Like taking bets on a gender reveal party &ndash; is d&rsquo;&Eacute;on
    a raging wildfire or a fight at Applebee&rsquo;s? (That&rsquo;s the two
    options, right?)</span

<p class="c31 c36">
  <span class="c4 c0"

    Charlotte-Genevi&egrave;ve-Louise-Augusta-Andr&eacute;a-Timoth&eacute;a
    d&rsquo;&Eacute;on de Beaumont. And that&rsquo;s basically where their story
    ends, but not because they stopped trying to be amazing. d&rsquo;&Eacute;on
    attempted to join French forces in assisting American colonists in the war
    for independence from Britain, but the French wouldn&rsquo;t allow a woman
    to fight. Then in 1792, d&rsquo;&Eacute;on offered to build an army of
    female soldiers to do battle against the Habsburgs, but they were told no.
    In fact, being recognized as a woman was enough to sideline as a skilled
    diplomat and spy who hadn&rsquo;t been stopped by anything else.</span

    >June 14 - Josephine Baker blows their minds and steals their secrets</span
  >
</h2>
<p class="c10">
  <span class="c4 c0"
    >Josephine Baker. What a star. The American-born French entertainer was the
    first Black woman to star in a major movie, she was the top-headliner at the
    famed Folies Berg&egrave;re in Paris, was the iconic fashionista of the Jazz
    Age, spy, civil rights activist, and bisexual.</span
  >
</p>
<p class="c22 c23"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p>
<p class="c23">
  <span class="c4 c0"
    >Baker was celebrated in her own time, sometimes called the most beautiful
    woman in the world, but always called talented. Her career began at around
    age 13 in New York during the Harlem Renaissance of the 1920s. She began in
    the chorus line, but she ad-libbed a bit of the performance to draw
    attention to herself. In 1925, she moved to Paris and starred in a show soon
    after, becoming an instant success. She embraced erotic dancing and
    wasn&rsquo;t afraid to show a little skin. Sometimes she performed with her
    pet cheetah &ndash; yeah, an actual cheetah &ndash; and it frequently
    escaped and terrorized the orchestra. The audience loved it.</span
  >
</p>
<p class="c23 c22"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p>
<p class="c23">
  <span class="c4 c0"
    >Baker toured Europe with her star on the rise. Her musical skill was beyond
    question, and her film appearances were always crowd favorites. Her physical
    humor and comedic timing made audiences love her.</span
  >
</p>
<p class="c23 c22"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p>
<p class="c23">
  <span class="c4 c0"
    >In 1939, the world changed with the outbreak of war in Europe. Germany
    invaded Poland prompting a cascade of war declarations, including
    Baker&rsquo;s now-home France. She joined a French spy agency, using her
    European stardom to rub elbows with German bigwigs all over the continent as
    she performed. After France fell, Baker left Paris but continued her work in
    subterfuge. She found out the locations of troop musters, airfields, and
    more, passing that information along to the English who were busy planning
    for the liberation of Europe.</span
  >
</p>
<p class="c23 c22"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p>
<p class="c23">
  <span class="c4 c0"
    >In 1941, she toured French territories in North Africa, ostensibly
    &ldquo;for her health&rdquo; but in reality because that was fertile ground
    for intelligence gathering. She&rsquo;d make notes of what she learned and
    tuck them in her underwear, hoping the Germans wouldn&rsquo;t give her the
    mandatory strip search because she was a star. During her stay in Africa,
    however, she struggled to recover from complications of a miscarriage, but
    once she was back on her feet, she created a troupe to entertain Allied
    soldiers in the region.</span
  >
</p>
<p class="c23 c22"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p>
<p class="c23">
  <span class="c4 c0"
    >After the war, Baker&rsquo;s stardom jumped to a whole new level. Her
    spying activity was well-known, and it freed her to take on riskier and more
    serious projects. In 1951, she was invited back to the United States to play
    a nightclub in Miami, but she refused to play unless the audience would be
    integrated. And her starpower was too much to ignore. The club relented and
    every performance she gave was sold out. She followed with a national tour
    to rave reviews. She similarly criticized the Stork Club for its
    segregationist policies, but unfortunately this time, the political machine
    turned against her and accused her of being a communist, a pretty serious
    allegation in 1950s America. She went home to France.</span
  >
</p>
<p class="c23 c22"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p>
<p class="c23">
  <span class="c4 c0"
    >But her refusal to bend to discrimination wasn&rsquo;t unrecognized. The
    NAACP declared Sunday, May 20, 1951 to be &ldquo;Josephine Baker Day.&rdquo;
    Baker joined the fight to save Willie McGee, a Black man dubiously-convicted
    of a crime, from death. She spoke alongside Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King,
    Jr., at the March on Washington. She had this to say:</span

<p class="c23 c43">
  <span class="c0">all over the world.</span><span class="c3 c48">&rdquo;</span>
</p>
<p class="c23 c22"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p>
<p class="c23">
  <span class="c4 c0"
    >Baker was married four times in her life, and between those marriages, she
    also had numerous relationships with other men and women, including,
    allegedly, famed painter Frida Kahlo.</span

</p>
<p class="c23 c22"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p>
<p class="c23">
  <span class="c4 c0"
    >Is her sexuality a footnote? Well, I mean, kinda. But that&rsquo;s the
    point. None of us are just one thing, and in an ideal world, the intrinsic
    characteristics of who we are should be unremarkable. But also kinda not a
    footnote. For a bisexual Black woman to become so prominent is surely an
    accomplishment, not because of her intrinsic being but in spite of the
    discrimination she faced because of it.</span

</p>
<p class="c23 c22"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p>
<p class="c23">
  <span class="c0"
    >Pride is all-encompassing. Whoever you are, you&rsquo;re valid and good. We
    exist at all kinds of identity intersections, and they should all be
    celebrated. And we should fight for equality and dignity along all those
    axes of identity, because none of us are free until all of us are free. </span

  <span class="c4 c0"
    >Do you know about the Lavender Scare? Just to recap in case you
    don&rsquo;t, alongside the anti-communist McCarthyism of the 1950s, there
    was a parallel moral panic about homosexuality, particularly within the
    federal government. One shortsighted argument against queer people in
    government service was that, due to the public stigma of homosexuality,
    homosexual people could be more easily blackmailed to subvert the United
    States. It&rsquo;s a self-reinforcing belief, but also wrong.</span

</p>
<p class="c9 c22"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p>
<p class="c9">
  <span class="c4 c0"
    >Anyway, under the Eisenhower White House, new policies were developed in
    1947 to effectively bar homosexuals from federal service, and many gay and
    lesbian federal employees were rooted out and fired. This was the Lavender

    turned to public service, first in academia and later as a federal civil
    servant in the US Army Map Service. In 1957, at a bus stop in San Francisco,
    Kameny allowed himself to be touched in a sexual way by another man. Police
    were watching the station and promptly arrested Kameny. Shortly thereafter,
    he was fired from the Army Map Service, and in 1958 he was barred from

    the fight to come. That was also the end of Kameny&rsquo;s paid career, as

    notion that homosexuals should adopt heteronormative behaviors in order to
    be accepted, arguing that nobody should be expected to change who they
    are:</span

<p class="c9 c22"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p>
<p class="c9">
  <span class="c4 c0"
    >In 1972, Kameny lobbied the American Psychiatric Association (APA) to
    question whether psychiatry was doing good or harm to the queer community.
    They asked several gay psychiatrists, but only Dr. John E. Fryer was willing
    to facilitate the conversation; he demanded that he be allowed to do it in
    disguise for fear of backlash, though. His testimony and the ensuing debate
    led the APA to remove homosexuality from the Diagnostic and Statistical
    Manual of Mental Disorders (DSM) in 1973, formally rejecting the idea that
    homosexuality was a disorder.</span

<p class="c9">
  <span class="c4 c0"

    earning the public support of the Washington Post, which noted that the men

    service, discrimination in the military, and in healthcare. Kameny was
    instrumental in much of the groundwork for the modern LGBTQ+ rights
    movement. When faced with discrimination, Kameny came out swinging and
    changed the world. Pride. He had it. </span

</h2>
<p class="c40 c75">
  <span class="c4 c0"
    >Sylvia Rivera was a drag queen in New York. She was raised as a boy but her
    effeminate nature was rejected by her family and she left home at the age of
    10, living instead on the streets. To survive, she turned to survival sex
    work, and was soon taken into the protection of local drag queens, including
    Marsha P. Johnson with whom she found a lifelong friendship.</span

<p class="c22 c28"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p>
<p class="c28">
  <span class="c4 c0"
    >In 1970, Rivera and Johnson co-founded the Street Transvestite Action
    Revolutionaries (STAR), advocating for homeless queer youth, especially
    those who turned to sex work. In addition to advocacy, the group also
    provided housing.</span

<p class="c28 c22"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p>
<p class="c28">
  <span class="c4 c0"
    >Rivera referred to herself as both a drag queen and a transvestite at this
    time, showing a fluidity about her identity, sometimes identifying as a man
    in a dress and other times calling herself a woman. (Later in life, she
    identified strictly as a woman, hence the &ldquo;she&rdquo; pronouns in this
    post.) But because she didn&rsquo;t fit social gender norms, she faced
    harassment. It was common through the 1960s and 1970s for people to be
    arrested for wearing the &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; gender&rsquo;s clothes, and as
    you can imagine, that meant Rivera got arrested.</span

<p class="c28 c22"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p>
<p class="c28">
  <span class="c4 c0"
    >Police brutality towards queer people was well-known, and being Latina made
    her even more vulnerable. On one occasion, Rivera escaped arrest by leaping
    from a moving police car.</span

<p class="c28">
  <span class="c4 c0"
    >Rivera was an adamant proponent of making the LGBTQ+ rights movement more
    inclusive, specifically advocating for drag queens, transvestites (which in
    her later speeches would include transgender people, a term which
    wasn&rsquo;t widely used in the 70s), the homeless, people of color, and sex
    workers. She believed that we all shared the same fight, and we can be most
    effective at securing our rights if we work together.</span

    identity could get them harmed, but Rivera never bothered with the closet.
    She was unashamed and loved herself; she even began wearing makeup to school
    in 4th grade! And her life demonstrated her belief that </span

    celebration of who we are and our collective march towards greater equality,

    men to wear the pink triangle in prison and concentration camps, and after
    the war, people decided to reclaim the symbol for their own use. In 1978,
    Gilbert Baker designed a new flag for the community to use, to replace the
    symbol born (and reclaimed from) hate. He was inspired by the rainbow&#39;s
    common usage in the earlier hippie movement of &quot;peace and love,&quot;
    and together with artist Lynn Segerblom, they created the first rainbow

    Day Parade. Later that year, gay lawmaker Harvey Milk was assassinated, and
    demand for the new flag skyrocketed. A local flag maker began producing them
    as quickly as they could, but using stock fabric that only included 7 colors
    &ndash; no hot pink. (Hot pink didn&#39;t return primarily because the
    fabric was just too hard to source.) And in 1979, the turquoise stripe was
    dropped so the flag could be split into two 3-stripe segments to sit on
    opposite sides of light poles.</span

    acceptance. But even so enshrined in our most important modern glyphs, the
    flag has continued to evolve. For example, in 2017, the Philadelphia Pride
    Flag introduced black and brown stripes to the top of the flag to bring
    awareness to the additional struggles faced by non-white queer people. In
    2018, the Progress Pride flag was introduced, incorporating the two
    additional stripes of the Philadelphia Pride flag into a chevron alongside
    the trans pride colors to make clear that trans people are part of the
    LGBTQ+ community. And in 2021, that Progress Pride flag was modified further
    to include intersex pride. (See below for these three flags!)</span

</h2>
<p class="c40 c62">
  <span class="c0"
    >Same-sex marriage is as old as marriage itself. Instances are recorded in
    ancient Egypt, China, Mesopotamia, and continental Europe. The ancient
    Greeks accepted same-sex relations on equal footing with opposite-sex
    relations, and the Roman marital rites were freely given to </span
  ><span class="c26 c0">any</span
  ><span class="c4 c0"
    >&nbsp;couple. Nero not only fiddled while Rome burned, but in his lifetime,
    he had at least two husbands. It really wasn&#39;t anything anyone cared
    about, but then people got very judgemental and very opinionated about right
    and wrong on the subject, and it became taboo in the western world starting
    around the 300s CE.</span

</p>
<p class="c27 c22"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p>
<p class="c27">
  <span class="c4 c0"
    >The relationships between same-sex couples didn&#39;t stop, of course, but
    they soon had to become more secretive and they lost the protection of the
    state. As European traders made their way to China, they brought their new
    beliefs with them, and as a response to later European colonization, China
    adopted laws against homosexuality on the hope of strengthening their own
    population to repel the invaders. Meanwhile, many African cultures were
    tolerant and accepting of various sexualities and genders, according to
    evidence collected by anthropologists. It wasn&#39;t until European
    colonization that attitudes began to shift. Many cultures in the Americas
    similarly accepted homosexual and nonbinary people and their relationships,
    and it was European colonizers who sought to crush this aspect (as well as
    most others) of indigenous American society.</span

<p class="c27">
  <span class="c4 c0"
    >But, things keep turning, and people keep fighting for justice. The first
    same-sex marriage in modern times was in 1971 in Minneapolis. Despite being
    technically illegal, a clerk granted the marriage license and it was never
    annulled or revoked. Their marriage wasn&#39;t recognized by the federal
    government, so the couple played shenanigans &ndash; one partner legally
    adopted the other and claimed them as a dependent on their taxes. Hey,
    whatever works! During the 1970s, many American LGBTQ+ rights activists
    believed that same-sex marriage was just a few years away from mainstream
    acceptance, but the HIV/AIDS crisis that began in the early 1980s derailed
    the movement.</span

<p class="c27">

    marriages when the Netherlands broadened the legal definition and conferred
    equal rights for all married couples. That kicked off a cascade, and today
    at least 34 countries have followed suit, including the United States in
    2015. And this year, the Choctaw Nation, Andorra, and Estonia all recognized
    marriage equality. And lots of other nations are reconsidering their past
    stance on the issue as well: Honduras, India, Japan, the Navajo Nation,

</h2>
<p class="c40 c60">
  <span class="c4 c0"
    >HIV likely made the jump from apes to humans in the 1920s. People with
    unusual symptoms were documented as early as the 1950s, and their tissue
    samples were later shown to be infected with HIV. But for the most part, the
    virus and associated illnesses were poorly understood until the 1980s, when
    it exploded around the world.</span
  >
</p>
<p class="c29 c22"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p>
<p class="c29">
  <span class="c4 c0"
    >By 1980, gay men in the United States were aware of some kind of illness
    spreading within their communities. In 1981, the Centers for Disease Control
    published a report about the surprising appearance of uncommon diseases
    among otherwise healthy men in cities across the US, with pneumocystis
    pneumonia and Kaposi&rsquo;s sarcoma chief among them. In 1982, researchers
    speculated that some as-yet unidentified pathogen was being transmitted by
    sexual activity, and the collection of symptoms was dubbed GRID for
    &ldquo;gay-related immune deficiency.&rdquo;</span
  >
</p>
<p class="c29 c22"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p>
<p class="c29">
  <span class="c4 c0"
    >The virus was isolated in 1983, but the damage to the queer community was
    already done. An entire generation of gay men would be decimated, with
    hundreds of thousands dead. And the fact that the virus initially spread
    primarily among gay men was fodder for anti-queer activists who had already
    begun mobilizing to oppose LGBTQ+ rights.</span

</p>
<p class="c29 c22"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p>
<p class="c29">
  <span class="c4 c0"
    >The name GRID was a political disaster for the LGBTQ+ community as a whole.
    The virus was not, in fact, gay-related at all. It did not and does not care
    about a person&rsquo;s sexual orientation. But anti-queer activists latched
    on to the idea and quickly began calling it &ldquo;gay plague,&rdquo; and
    claiming it was their god&rsquo;s wrath striking down sinners. There
    wasn&rsquo;t much news coverage or public interest &ndash;&nbsp;after all,
    only &ldquo;those&rdquo; people got sick. Sex workers, intravenous drug
    users, gay men? Society didn&rsquo;t really care.</span

</p>
<p class="c29 c22"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p>
<p class="c29">
  <span class="c4 c0"
    >But, as we know, queer people fight back. It was gay community leaders who
    proposed renaming the condition to AIDS, for example. Political leaders
    often didn&rsquo;t want to engage on the issue, so queer folks brought the
    conversation to their doorsteps, marching and protesting at their offices or
    public events. To gather more attention, the protestors staged
    &ldquo;die-ins,&rdquo; modeled on Black civil rights sit-ins, where they
    would lie down in streets, churches, or other high-profile places to
    symbolize those who had died and were dying.</span

<p class="c29">
  <span class="c0"
    >ACT UP was formed in 1987 to be a more active political organization, and
    they didn&rsquo;t let anyone off the hook. The White House was infamously
    silent about HIV/AIDS, and did little to make resources available for the
    study, prevention, or treatment of the disease. In response. ACT UP took up
    a protest outside the US Federal Drug Administration in 1988, shutting the
    office down entirely while chanting, &ldquo;Hey, Hey! FDA! How many people
    have you killed today?&rdquo; Because they effectively shut down a
    government agency, they got a </span
  ><span class="c26 c0 c14">lot</span
  ><span class="c4 c0"
    >&nbsp;of attention, and that led to a dramatic increase in funding for
    HIV/AIDS-related programs. In 1988, the Department of Justice reversed an
    earlier policy and prevented discrimination on the basis of HIV diagnosis
    (later incorporated into law in the Americans With Disabilities Act), and
    the FDA substantially lowered the cost of one of the most effective HIV
    drugs, AZT.</span

<p class="c29 c22"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p>
<p class="c29">
  <span class="c4 c0"
    >Public and political perception of HIV/AIDS shifted dramatically due to the
    work of activists and organizations like ACT UP. It was not an easy fight,
    but it was effective. Public funding of research has led us to highly
    effective treatments and even preventative medication. Today, people
    infected with HIV and with access to healthcare can expect to live long,
    healthy lives thanks to new medicines that suppress the virus so
    successfully that it can&rsquo;t even be transmitted to others (often called
    &ldquo;undetectable&rdquo;). This would not be possible without the work of
    these activists and the impressive protests they put on.</span

    perception or in statistics. The epidemic is still raging and more work is
    needed to make treatment available to everyone. But the hard work of LGBTQ+
    activists broke open the gates of research funding that have made HIV less

<p class="c8 c22"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p>
<p class="c8">
  <span class="c0"
    >Early films didn&rsquo;t shy away from LGBTQ+ representation. Charlie
    Chaplin played up &ldquo;sissy&rdquo; stereotypes when his character was
    mocked for appearing to kiss another man. A 1919 German film told the story
    of a gay man who committed suicide after being blackmailed for his
    sexuality, advocating for more acceptance. In 1930, actress Marlene
    Dietrich, bisexual herself, added a scene to the movie </span

<p class="c8">
  <span class="c4 c0"
    >Alas, in 1934, Hollywood studios adopted the Hays Code, a strict set of
    rules about what was and wasn&rsquo;t allowed in film. Positive depictions
    of homosexuality were strictly forbidden. Movies had to go through censors
    before they could be shown to audiences, and censors would eagerly chop out
    scenes that violated the code. As a result, queer representation was
    reduced. But&hellip; not eliminated.</span

    the word &ldquo;gay&rdquo; was used to mean homosexual, but surely that ran
    afoul of the Hays Code? Well, technically yes, they were able to skirt it
    because &ldquo;gay&rdquo; wasn&rsquo;t well-known slang for a homosexual man
    yet, and they told censors that Grant&rsquo;s character was referring to
    being very silly. But closeted Hollywood actors used the term to describe
    themselves, and Grant was friends with several gay actors so he knew what he
    was doing when he ad-libbed the line. (Delightful movie, by the way.)</span

    >June 26 - Martha P. Johnson doesn&rsquo;t throw a brick but does
    fight</span

</h2>
<p class="c16">
  <span class="c0"
    >Marsha P. Johnson was a major LGBTQ+ rights activist and drag queen in New
    York City. You may have heard that they threw the first brick at the
    Stonewall riots, a nod to Johnson&rsquo;s importance though inaccurate
    &ndash;&nbsp;Johnson wasn&rsquo;t there when the patrons began fighting back
    against police harassment, and Johnson consistently corrected rumors to the
    contrary. But Johnson </span
  ><span class="c26 c0">did</span
  ><span class="c4 c0"
    >&nbsp;cofound Street Transvestite Action Revolutionaries (STAR) with Sylvia
    Rivera, to promote the rights and safety of queer youth and sex workers.
    Many young LGBTQ+ people ended up in &ldquo;survival prostitution&rdquo;
    after being cast out by their families, and organizations like STAR helped
    them survive and build their new lives.</span
  >
</p>
<p class="c1 c22"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1">
  <span class="c0"
    >Marsha P. Johnson was more than just an activist, too. They were </span
  ><span class="c0">a performer</span
  ><span class="c4 c0"
    >, doing regular drag shows in outfits designed to showcase both masculine
    and feminine at the same time. They modeled for photography, most notably a
    session for Andy Warhol in 1975. They sang with the New York City Gay
    Men&rsquo;s Chorus. And Johnson was also just plain nice, known as
    &ldquo;the mayor of Christopher Street&rdquo; in Greenwich Village because
    they were so welcoming.</span
  >
</p>
<p class="c1 c22"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1">
  <span class="c0">But Johnson had to fight discrimination from </span
  ><span class="c26 c0">within</span
  ><span class="c4 c0"
    >&nbsp;the LGBTQ+ community. As a drag queen, they were not readily accepted
    as a civil rights figure. Many people were afraid that their presence would
    actually hinder the queer rights movement. In fact, Johnson and Rivera were
    both banned from the 1973 Pride parade. In response, the pair held their own
    parade &ndash;&nbsp;marching down the street immediately in front of the
    official Pride parade.</span
  >
</p>
<p class="c1 c22"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1">
  <span class="c4 c0"
    >When the HIV/AIDS crisis hit, Johnson &ndash;&nbsp;who eventually
    contracted the disease &ndash; committed to visiting and sitting with
    patients in the hospital so they wouldn&rsquo;t have to suffer and die
    alone. They also joined ACT UP, bringing their signature flair to AIDS
    activism.</span
  >
</p>
<p class="c1 c22"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1">
  <span class="c4 c0"
    >Besides being a gifted performer, a welcoming figure in the community, and
    an outspoken advocate for social outcasts, Johnson also had a delightful
    sense of humor. They originally adopted the drag name &ldquo;Black
    Marsha&rdquo; but eventually settled on Marsha P. Johnson, taking
    &ldquo;Johnson&rdquo; from the Howard Johnson&rsquo;s restaurant. The P
    stands for &ldquo;pay it no mind,&rdquo; a phrase Johnson often used
    sarcastically when asked about their gender. When asked about their name in
    court, Johnson told the judge exactly what the P stood for, which amused the
    judge and led to Johnson being released.</span
  >
</p>
<p class="c1 c22"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p>
<p class="c1">
  <span class="c4 c0"
    >In the early 1990s, anti-queer violence was peaking in America with
    thousands of anti-LGBTQ+ hate crimes reported around the country, including
    many committed by police. In 1992, Johnson&rsquo;s body was discovered in
    the Hudson River. Police immediately declared it a suicide, but
    Johnson&rsquo;s friends denied that. Considering Johnson&rsquo;s outspoken
    activism and the hate-fueled anti-queer violence permeating New York City at
    the time, homicide seems likely. In 2002, the New York police department
    finally acknowledged that Johnson&rsquo;s death was unlikely to be suicide,
    but through at least 2016, they still refused to reopen the case and
    investigate.</span

<p class="c1">
  <span class="c0"
    >For Pride today, we reject our predecessors&rsquo; bias against drag
    queens, thanks to activists like Marsha P. Johnson. Their welcoming demeanor
    and work with STAR helped young queer people, cut off by their families,
    find safety and stability. Their compassion helped people suffering from
    HIV/AIDS to at least have a friend to accompany them. We celebrate their
    compassion, their humor, their creativity, their courage, and their

  <span class="c4 c7"
    >June 27 - Roberta Cowell rules the skies and the racetrack</span
  >
</h2>
<p class="c40">
  <span class="c4 c0"
    >Roberta Cowell was born in the United Kingdom in 1918 and was a transgender
    woman. She attended an all-boys public school, where she joined the motor
    club, learning about race cars, engines, and other miscellaneous mechanical
    knowledge. In the early 1930s, she made a school trip to Germany where she
    exercised another hobby, filmmaking, taking footage of drills being
    conducted by nazi soldiers. She was arrested, but the nazis let her go when
    she promised to destroy the film. She did not destroy the film, instead
    destroying a blank roll of film to fool the nazis.</span
  >
</p>
<p class="c31 c22"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p>
<p class="c31">
  <span class="c4 c0"
    >After school at just 16 years old, Cowell got a job as an aircraft
    engineer, and with war looming, she soon joined the Royal Air Force.
    Unfortunately, she suffered from motion sickness, so she was discharged from
    the service. Cowell then turned back to her love of automobiles and took up
    auto racing. In 1936, while studying engineering in college, she won a race
    at Land&rsquo;s End Speed Trials. And she learned a lot about cars by
    putting on mechanic&rsquo;s clothes, sneaking into the garages, and offering
    to help anyone who needed it. Within three years, she owned three race cars
    of her own and was a regular competitor.</span
  >
</p>
<p class="c31 c22"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p>
<p class="c31">
  <span class="c4 c0"
    >Eventually the looming war became a present war, and in late 1940, Cowell
    was back in military service, this time in the British army. She served
    outside of the UK for a year before transferring back into the Royal Air
    Force. Here she served on the frontlines in a British Spitfire, and narrowly
    escaped disaster when the oxygen system on her plane conked out at 30,000
    feet. She passed out, but mercifully the plane continued flying. Over enemy
    territory. Through anti-aircraft fire. Somehow she survived, regaining
    consciousness an hour later as the plane descended, and she was able to
    return home.</span
  >
</p>
<p class="c31 c22"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p>
<p class="c31">
  <span class="c4 c0"
    >In another event, her plane was shot down and she was captured by nazis.
    She didn&rsquo;t go quietly, though. She attempted to escape twice before
    they even got her back to their camp. She ended up in solitary confinement
    before being transferred to a prisoner of war camp, where she remained until
    liberated by the Soviet army in 1945.</span
  >
</p>
<p class="c22 c31"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p>
<p class="c31">
  <span class="c4 c0"
    >After the war, Cowell returned to racing in events across Europe, but PTSD
    troubled her. After seeing a psychiatrist for a while, she realized that
    she&rsquo;d aggressively repressed her femininity and would be more
    comfortable embracing and identifying as a woman. She began hormone
    treatments and soon had the first of a pair of &ldquo;sex change&rdquo;
    surgeries. A gynecologist declared her intersex, which opened the door for
    her to get a new birth certificate and name change. In 1951, she underwent
    the second surgery.</span
  >
</p>
<p class="c31 c22"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p>
<p class="c31">
  <span class="c4 c0"
    >The surgeries were illegal in the UK at the time due to anti-LGBTQ+ bigotry
    coupled with a poor understanding of gender generally and transgender
    identity in particular. The same attitudes cost Cowell her businesses and
    prevented her from getting jobs. Her primary source of income through the
    mid-1950s was through selling her story &ndash;&nbsp;first to a UK magazine
    and then from her autobiography. She did continue her racing career, to the
    extent she was allowed, and continued to win.</span
  >
</p>
<p class="c31 c22"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p>
<p class="c31">
  <span class="c4 c0"
    >When her story landed in the United States, it was a sensation. And
    groundbreaking. At the time, people undergoing gender-affirming surgery were
    closely associated with the taboo of homosexual or effeminate men. Cowell
    shattered both of those views: she was not homosexual, having previously
    been married to a woman and raising children; and she was not effeminate,
    being a World War II ace fighter pilot and an automobile racing star.</span
  >
</p>
<p class="c31 c22"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p>
<p class="c31">
  <span class="c0"
    >During Pride, we celebrate people for who they are. Cowell was a race
    car-driving fighter pilot who just needed time to recognize and understand
    their gender identity. She demonstrated that gender does not have to box us
    into &ndash;&nbsp;or </span
  ><span class="c26 c0 c14">out of</span
  ><span class="c0"
    >&nbsp;&ndash; anything, and in doing so, she opened Americans&rsquo; eyes
    to the possibility that people who receiving gender-affirming care could
    possibly be normal people. While she was still considered a spectacle in her
    own time, challenging the misconceptions people held about trans people laid
    important groundwork for a more accepting future. </span

  <span class="c21 c7">June 28 - Category IS&hellip; Ballroom realness</span>
</h2>
<p class="c40 c70">
  <span class="c0"
    >Drag has its roots in the late 19th century, when people would gather in
    private to wear the &ldquo;wrong&rdquo; gender&rsquo;s clothes, in direct
    defiance of laws banning that practice. (In the United States, these laws
    persisted into the 2000s, though courts would immediately throw them out.
    They were actively used to justify police harassment into at least the
    1980s.) William Dorsey Swann, the first person we know to have called
    themselves a drag queen, had been enslaved, and most of his drag events were
    filled with other formerly enslaved men. White gay men were welcome at his
    drag balls, and soon they began hosting them as well. Despite being
    integrated balls, there was still a bright streak of racism: all of the
    judges were white and only white performers won awards. This persisted until
    the 1960s, when Latino and Black attendees grew fed up and started their </span
  ><span class="c26 c0">own</span><span class="c4 c0">&nbsp;balls.</span>
</p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p>
<p class="c24">
  <span class="c4 c0"
    >Thus, modern Ballroom culture was born in Harlem. The new Ballroom culture
    was meant to be inclusive of all LGBTQ+ people, explicitly embracing and
    celebrating those who faced discrimination within the larger LGBTQ+
    community at the time. Ballroom was one of the few places that transgender
    people, especially transgender people of color, could safely be themselves
    in a welcoming community. To support this diversity, Balls often had
    competitions in a very wide range of categories so everyone in the community
    could find a niche to compete in.</span
  >
</p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p>
<p class="c24">
  <span class="c0"
    >In the 1980s, voguing developed in the Ballroom, a highly stylized form of
    dance where the body is used to create symmetrical shapes and forms with
    graceful movement between distinct poses. It further evolved into &ldquo;new
    way vogue,&rdquo; which deemphasized holding poses in favor of more
    continuous movement, rapidly &ldquo;snapping&rdquo; between poses and
    demonstrating more flexibility than the straight lines of &ldquo;old
    way.&rdquo; Voguing takes its name from </span
  ><span class="c26 c0">Vogue</span
  ><span class="c0"
    >&nbsp;magazine whose cover model poses were an inspiration to dancers. It
    reached mainstream audiences when Madonna released her song </span
  ><span class="c26 c0">Vogue</span
  ><span class="c4 c0"
    >&nbsp;in 1990, drawing on her experience attending and watching Ballroom
    performances.</span
  >
</p>
<p class="c2"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p>
<p class="c24">
  <span class="c0"
    >And Ballroom continues today! Balls are hosted regularly and around the
    world. The influence and legacy of Ballroom has made its way throughout
    queer culture, and has even seeped into mainstream entertainment, with shows
    like </span
  ><span class="c26 c0">RuPaul&rsquo;s Drag Race</span
  ><span class="c4 c0"
    >&nbsp;finding major success with traditional Ballroom categories and
    performance styles. The language of Ballroom has also broken out into wider
    usage with terms like &ldquo;shade,&rdquo; &ldquo;werk,&rdquo; and
    &ldquo;fierce&rdquo; entering the common parlance.</span

<p class="c2"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p>

  <span class="c0"
    >Pride celebrates all aspects of all LGBTQ+ people, and especially
    highlights those who have fought against intersectional injustice, such as
    being queer and a racial minority. Ballroom is that: Black and Latino LGBTQ+
    people fighting back against racism and homophobia, making their own space,
    and winning more acceptance for themselves &ndash; and all of us &ndash; in
    the process. </span

    >Hip-hop was born in the late 1970s in the Bronx, in response to and
    influenced by the popularity of disco. Disco was, in many ways, a revival of
    energetic dance halls, and quite often discotheques were open to everyone
    &ndash; explicitly included people who&rsquo;d been excluded previously:
    Black, Hispanic, Latino, and LGBTQ+. As a result, early hip-hop had close
    ties to the queer community.</span

    >Many hip-hop and rap artists soon adopted toxic masculinity in their
    lyrics, however, which also meant homophobic language. Even today, some use
    homophobic language in their music despite expressing allyship elsewhere.
    That said, since at least the early 1990s, hip-hop and rap had become large
    and diverse genres, including many openly LGBTQ+ artists. Meshell
    Ndegeocello, an openly bisexual Black woman, for example, discussed
    sexuality and the intersectionality of sexuality and Blackness in America.
    And that&rsquo;s really no surprise; rap and hip-hop had been confronting
    social justice issues since almost day one.</span

    >Frank Ocean made a big splash when he publicly came out in 2012, becoming
    the first mainstream successful Black gay male hip-hop artist. In late 2018,
    a relatively unknown artist named Lil Nas X released a country/rap song
    titled &ldquo;Old Town Road,&rdquo; and it blew up. First it went viral as
    the soundtrack for a TikTok trend (largely because of serious work Lil Nas X
    put into promoting it). It reached number one on the Billboard Hot 100
    chart, and debuted at #19 on the country chart and #36 on the
    R&amp;B/hip-hop chart. The song set the record for most streams of a single
    song in a week, with over 140 million listens. By late August, the song had
    over a billion listens on Spotify alone.</span

    >On the last day of Pride in 2019, Lil Nas X tweeted to the world that he is
    gay. In 2021, he released the song and accompanying music video for Montero.
    The lyrics are pretty gay, but the music video is just an outright queer
    festival: homosexuality on full display, high drag, gender-bending, and a
    shot across the bow of those who claim being LGBTQ+ is immoral. This kind of
    emotional explosion is not uncommon with coming out. It&rsquo;s normal for
    all the feelings that had been locked inside the closet to come pouring out
    when the doors first open, and those emotions can include a lot of anger
    &ndash; for the time lost to hiding, for the self-loathing, and for the
    people who made you feel unsafe.</span

</p>
<p class="c13"><span class="c4 c0"></span></p>
<p class="c19">
  <span class="c0"
    >Anyway, Lil Nas X has never shied away from his identity since then, using
    his music to explore more of his experience growing up in the closet and
    coming to terms with his sexuality. He&rsquo;s also never backed down from
    people who criticize him for being gay or for his artistic expression,
    instead embracing, extending, and inventing memes meant to validate LGBTQ+
    identities in the face of attempted oppression. And in 2023, after more
    introspection &ndash; and with the freedom to explore himself &ndash; he
    came out as &ldquo;a little bit bisexual.&rdquo;</span

    >At Pride, we celebrate the younger generations continuing the fight for
    justice, equality, and respect. The work of generations past have made it
    safer and more acceptable to be openly queer, and today&rsquo;s younger
    generations are taking that and building on top of it to make the world more
    inclusive and just. Lil Nas X wasn&rsquo;t the first openly gay Black male
    hip-hop/rap artist, and because of the way he uses his stardom, he
    won&rsquo;t be the last. For Pride, we celebrate those who came before,
    those who are here now, and those who are coming next. </span

    otherwise, we&rsquo;ll be here until the end, too. The whole, giant spectrum
    of us: lesbian, bisexual, transgender, asexual, gay, nonbinary, pansexual,
    genderqueer, intersex, and everyone else too. None of the various queer
    identities are new, though the language we have to describe them may be.

    >I had a final feel-good message prepared for the last day of Pride, but not
    anymore. Today the Supreme Court ruled that LGBTQ+ people do not deserve
    protection in the public sphere. The question at hand was simply this: can a
    business discriminate against someone based on their inherent being, if that
    business has a &ldquo;deeply-held belief&rdquo; that those people are
    immoral. The Supreme Court said yes, the business can discriminate. It is
    just a breath away from overturning major provisions of the 1964 Civil
    Rights Act. If businesses can refuse service to queer people because they
    believe queer people are immoral, what&rsquo;s stopping businesses from
    making the same argument about people of color? Women? Muslims? Etc.
    It&rsquo;s a very slippery slope.</span
