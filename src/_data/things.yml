    how I work or the kinds of things I work on, this section is for you.
  things:
    - name: Personal README
      url: /readme
      about: >
        A personal README is a great place to tell colleagues about how you like
        to work. This is mine!
    - name: Things I contributed to
      url: /work
      about: >
        I was a federal civil servant for over 17 years. I decided to reflect
        on what I've done with my time.

  things:
    - name: Blog
      url: /blog
      about: >
        I don't often think about typing up my thoughts into blog posts, but
        every now and then, I remember. And this is them.
    - name: Pride posts, 2023
      url: /pride

        A series of LGBTQ+ Pride posts I wrote for work in 2023.
    - name: African American History Month 2025

      about: >
        A series of posts about African American history I wrote for work in
        2025. My position was eliminated and I was effectively fired by DOGE
        before I could finish the month.

- group: Drawings
  description: >
    I like to draw. It brings me joy. Here are some of my drawing collections.
  things:
    - name: Today in History
      url: /today-in-history
      about: >
        Silly illustrations of significant events in history. I didn't make it
        through a full calendar year before I stopped doing them. Sorry 'bout
        it.
    - name: Alphabet of Animals
      url: /animals
      about: >
        Drawings of animals for each letter of the alphabet with almost 100%
        entirely real animals!
    - name: Alphabet of Cartoon Characters
      url: /toons
      about: >
        Drawings of cartoon characters for some of the letters of the alphabet.
        My interest in the project petered out before I finished.

- group: Weather
  description: >
    I'm a weather nerd. I love watching an outbreak of thunderstorms or trying
    to guess how much snow we might get. To that end, I've used the National
    Weather Service public API to build some sites for myself.
  things:
    - name: When is going to snow?
      url: /next-snow
      about: >
        A page that uses your location data or a ZIP code you type in to look
        for the next snow in your forecast.
    - name: Atlantic hurricanes
      url: /atlantic-hurricanes
      about: >
        A different presentation of the information available from the National
        Hurricane Center. Scraped directly from the source on a regular basis.
    - name: Storm Prediction Center
      url: /spc
      about: >
        A different presentation of the next 3 days' convective outlooks from
        the Storm Prediction Center (SPC). It uses GIS data directly from SPC,
        plus a little text parsing to handle the discussion.

  description: >
    And a few other things I've done that don't really fit any particular theme.
  things:
    - name: Pottery projects
      url: /pottery-projects
      about: >
        Some of my early pottery projects. I lost interest in keeping it
        updated pretty early into my pottery practice.
    - name: CSS sphere
      url: /css-sphere
      about: >
        I was introduced to CSS's 3D transformations, so naturally I wondered
        if it was possible to make a globe in just CSS. The answer is... kinda!
        (Not really. This uses a lot of Javascript to update the CSS transforms
        over time.) Anyway, here's what I came up with. It's janky!
    - name: Pixures
      url: /gifs
      about: >
        A small, curated collection of GIFs that I like.
