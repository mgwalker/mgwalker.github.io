      about: >
        A personal README is a great place to tell colleagues about how you like
        to work. This is mine!

        I was a federal civil servant for over 17 years. I decided to reflect

      url: /blog
      about: >
        I don't often think about typing up my thoughts into blog posts, but

      about: >
        A series of posts about African American history I wrote for work in
        2025. My position was eliminated and I was effectively fired by DOGE
        before I could finish the month.

    I like to draw. It brings me joy. Here are some of my drawing collections.

      url: /today-in-history
      about: >
        Silly illustrations of significant events in history. I didn't make it

        it.

      url: /toons
      about: >

        My interest in the project petered out before I finished.

- group: Weather
  description: >
    I'm a weather nerd. I love watching an outbreak of thunderstorms or trying
    to guess how much snow we might get. To that end, I've used the National
    Weather Service public API to build some sites for myself.
  things:
    - name: When is going to snow?
      image: /assets/images/snow.png
      url: /next-snow
      about: >
        A page that uses your location data or a ZIP code you type in to look
        for the next snow in your forecast.
    - name: Atlantic hurricanes
      image: /assets/images/hurricane.png
      url: /atlantic-hurricanes
      about: >
        A different presentation of the information available from the National
        Hurricane Center. Scraped directly from the source on a regular basis.
    - name: Storm Prediction Center
      image: /assets/images/spc.png
      url: /spc
      about: >
        A different presentation of the next 3 days' convective outlooks from
        the Storm Prediction Center (SPC). It uses GIS data directly from SPC,
        plus a little text parsing to handle the discussion.

    And a few other things I've done that don't really fit any particular theme.
  things:
    - name: Pottery projects
      image: /assets/images/pottery.png
      url: /pottery-projects
      about: >
        Some of my early pottery projects. I lost interest in keeping it
        updated pretty early into my pottery practice.
    - name: CSS sphere
      image: /assets/images/css-sphere.png
      url: /css-sphere
      about: >
        I was introduced to CSS's 3D transformations, so naturally I wondered
        if it was possible to make a globe in just CSS. The answer is... kinda!
        (Not really. This uses a lot of Javascript to update the CSS transforms
        over time.) Anyway, here's what I came up with. It's janky!
    - name: Pixures

      about: >
        A small, curated collection of GIFs that I like.
