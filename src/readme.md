# Working with Me

### Intro

- **Name pronunciation**: gr-EGG WALL-ker
- **Pronouns**: he/him
- **Chapter**: 18F Engineering
- **Started**: January, 2016
- **Location**: Minneapolis, MN
- **Working hours**: 8:00 am CT to 5:30 pm CT

### Skills

- backend coding (mostly Node.js these days, but I can get around in Python,
  and I would welcome an excuse to play with Swift or C# again)
- "back of the frontend" coding (the Javascript parts of the frontend; I can do
  HTML, but CSS for anything complex is a struggle)
- communicating without jargon

### Work style preferences

- I'm usually at work by 9am central time, but I'd prefer not to take meetings
  before 10am. If we need an earlier meeting, just let me know and we can make
  it work; just please show me some grace because I'm not an early person.
- I eat lunch. If you need to schedule through my lunch block, please try to let
  me know beforehand, and also don't be surprised if I eat during our meeting.
- I'm generally pretty flexible, otherwise, and I don't mind changing things up
  if it turns out something isn't working for someone.

### Count on me to...

- Bring some humor and silliness to work. I believe that we can do our best
  work in places where we can have fun.
- See the ways our seemingly small work can blossom into huge impacts. We are
  only with our partners for a fairly short time and sometimes when we leave,
  it can feel like we didn't do anything. But government is a very long game,
  and the small things we do today will ripple for years to come.
- Celebrate our entire team. We do great work here at 18F and we should
  acknowledge and celebrate our accomplishments.

### Hobbies and interests

- playing with my dog
- video games, sometimes
- running
- drawing
- pottery

### Projects I've worked on

_(most recent first)_

- ### National Weather Service public API

  This one is brand new. We're still discovering what we're gonna do!

- ### National Weather Service weather.gov

  We worked with the National Weather Service to entirely rebuild
  weather.gov (not yet launched). The site is built on Drupal for
  its content management needs, templated through Twig, and pulls
  data from the NWS public API through a Node.js app we call the
  "interop layer" that puts all the data into the format our Twig
  templates expect. This is one of the best projects I've worked
  on at 18F, and it's still ongoing!

- ### 18F Delivery Assurance

  Recurring. As of February 2023, this is where 18F staff go when they're
  between projects. It's a team that works on various 18F products that are
  otherwise difficult to maintain due to our funding structure.

- ### Team Talent support for TTSJobs site

  The TTSJobs site is how our Talent Team advertises job openings to the world.
  It's been difficult for the Talent Team members to add new jobs because the
  pages are littered with conditional logic, in the Liquid template language,
  embedded in Markdown, relying heavily on frontmatter. The gist of my work was
  to make it easier for Talent to create and update job postings. This included
  a major overhaul to the base template they start with, moving logic into
  Liquid includes, and reducing reliance on frontmatter.

- ### Co-working Adventures Team

  A small internal-to-18F team worked on a model of sustainable long-term
  product maintance, optimizing for rapidly onboarding and offboarding other
  18F staff when they are briefly between projects. We have several internal
  products (such as the [UX Guide](https://ux-guide.18f.gov/)) that are tough to
  maintain with staff on billable projects all the time, and our work was to
  find ways to make it easier for staff to drop in and out of maintaining these
  kinds of products.

- ### OCC de-risking workshops

  Working with the Office of Child Care (OCC) in the Administration of Children
  and Families (ACF), we presented a virtual version of our tech procurement
  de-risking workshop to several OCC grantees (states, territories, and tribal
  authorities). We recorded the content and made it available online. With the
  help and input of OCC, we identified a few grantees for a deeper one-on-one
  consultation to dive into their specific needs and try to give them useful
  suggestions or advice. Along with helping OCC and its grantees, we also took
  this time to pull de-risking workshop content together and package it into a
  more readily reusable format.

- ### ACF OPRE

  Joined in progress. We worked with the Administration of Children and Family's
  (ACF) Office of Planning, Research and Evaluation (OPRE). OPRE is responsible
  for a significant amount of research and evaluation grants, and they have a
  legacy system that helps them track information about those various ongoing
  projects. However, the legacy system no longer meets their needs and OPRE
  staff are forced to manually collect and correlate a significant amount of
  information. We originally intended to help OPRE by starting to build a new
  product and eventually hand it off to a vendor team. However, due to internal
  TTS constraints, the engagement was truncated and we ultimately focused on
  helping OPRE write a solicitation and select a vendor to build the entire
  product.

- ### State of Washington IE&E modernization

  Joined in progress. The state of Washington is currently in the process of
  rethinking their public benefits system, including potentially integrating
  various programs. One potential starting point is integrating eligibility and
  enrollment for all the programs into a single application. We joined the state
  to help work through building out the first parts of a new digital system in
  a user-centered, iterative way. Unfortunately, due to internal TTS issues, we
  were not able to continue this engagement and had to end it before we felt we
  had made much progress. Our partners at Washington were great and eager to
  eager to adopt new practices, but we just didn't have enough time (and they
  didn't either, honestly) to establish those.

- ### CMS contract terminiation path analysis

  We worked with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to do some
  research into how and why state Medicaid IT contracts were terminated to try
  to figure out ways to improve outcomes. This was a research-intensive project
  that involved a bunch of interviews, and we learned a bunch about the
  incentives at play. In coordination with our partners at CMS, we wrote a
  report that outlined our findings and offered some proposals for how to
  improve the odds of contracts producing value. Our recommendations touched on
  the roles of CMS, the states, and the IT vendors, and were well-received by
  everyone involved, including the vendor community.

- ### NASA SBIR

  Another project I joined in progress. 18F was originally supposed to help NASA
  build an acquisition to replace the vendor on their SBIR system, which is the
  tool small business use to apply for research contracts (essentially). Later,
  NASA decided to keep the same vendor, so we transitioned to working with NASA
  to map out a path to product ownership, iterative development, and moving the
  existing SBIR system into NASA-owned infrastructure.

- ### CMS CARTS

  The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) Children's Health
  Insurance Program (CHIP) was building a new web application for states to
  report on program access, service quality, and individuals' experiences with
  CHIP services. 18F was co-developing the app with a vendor team. I joined the
  project in-progress. While everyone on the team - CMS, 18F, and the vendor -
  was committed to the work and trying their best, for various reasons, the
  project was not successful. In this project, we had to navigate some difficult
  interpersonal issues and terminate our engagement early.

- ### USFS firewoord permitting

  The US Forest Service (USFS) was building a web application to allow members
  of the public to buy permits to harvest firewood from national forests. 18F's
  role was product coaching and helping to provide technical oversite and
  quality assurance. I joined the project in-progress. Unfortunately, our USFS
  teammates weren't in a good position to properly own and manage the product at
  the time, largely due to being shorthanded and very busy with other tasks, so
  the project ended early.

- ### 10x phase ones

  Various. I don't think they were anything special; pretty typical phase ones.

- ### CMS APD research and eAPD

  Following our work with the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS)
  on state Medicaid systems, we asked if we could help CMS research their
  Advance Planning Document (APD) process, because we had come to suspect it
  was an impediment to states adopting the best practices CMS was asking of
  them. Our research led CMS to choose to build a web tool for building APDs,
  called eAPD. We worked with CMS product leads on building the tool while also
  helping them practice product management and ownership for about 3 years. We
  rolled off shortly after bringing on a vendor team. The product is planned
  to go live in 2021, and our product friends at CMS are still driving the eAPD
  ship. This is probably my favorite project from my time at 18F so far.

- ### National Geospatial Intelligence Agency (NGA)

  It wasn't prestigious or secret work. We were mostly helping them figure out
  how to word procurement documents so they would attract the right vendors
  and then how to evaluate the vendor responses they got so they could pick
  a team that would be most likely to deliver successfully.

- ### Department of Labor 14(c)

  We worked with the Department of Labor to try to create a more streamlined
  application for businesses to get 14(c) certificates. This was an acquisition
  using 18F's now-deprecated Agile BPA, and my role was mostly post-award
  management stuff related to technical quality review.

- ### State Medicaid acquisition consulting

  Starting in 2016, we first worked with states through the Centers for
  Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) to help figure out paths towards
  modernizing their MMIS systems, and then later we worked directly with the
  states. We realized that MMIS systems were too complex to start with, so we
  transitioned more to working with eligibility and enrollment (E&E) systems.
  These projects involved migrating data and workflows from mainframes, and our
  focus was on working with our state partners to outline a technical approach
  and build an acquisition plan for getting good vendors in to help the state
  implement the plan. We also worked on getting our state partners ready to
  work in a user-centered, iterative way and to take ownership of the products
  they were building.

- ### Unaccompanied Children

  Worked with the Office of Refugee Resettlement in the Administration of
  Childrens and Families (in HHS) to evaluate the IT systems they used to keep
  track of children who crossed the border without an accompanying adult. These
  children were often temporarily held in government or contracted facilities
  until a family member in the United States could be found to take them in.
  The software they were working with caused them significant problems, and we
  proposed several possible paths forward. The project ended before making a
  choice or implementing a solution.

## Prior to 18F

Before 18F, I worked as a civilian in the US Army Corps of Engineers (USACE)
at the Engineer Research and Development Center (ERDC). (I agree, it ought to be
"Engineering" but nobody asked me.) USACE has a joint military and civil service
mission. The civil service mission is broad, including things such as
environmental protection, navigable waterways, managing all public dams, and
disaster response and relief. The civil mission is mostly staffed by civilian
personnel. The military mission is to serve all the engineering needs of the US
Army, and is mostly staffed by military personnel.

- ### Engineered Resilient Systems

  Worked with military services to build tools to help them more thoroughly
  consider design candidates for new vehicle systems that could meet a wide set
  of mission requirements over a long period of time. These vehicle designs were
  deemed "resilient" because they would reduce lifetime operational costs. In
  essence, we built tools to analyze very large, multidimensional model data
  to identify clusters of design candidates that satisfied miission constraints
  so designers and decisionmakers could narrow their focus more quickly. For
  this work, I was awarded an Army civilian service medal.

- ### Deployable Force Protection

  Worked across various Army offices to support initiatives aimed at keeping
  military personnel safe in deployment. We helped build tools to translate
  all sensor inputs into a common protocol that enabled greater integration than
  was otherwise possible. In a second phase, we proposed and began development
  of a small drone platform that integrated with the sensor protocol to provide
  fast visual inspection of sensor-detected threats.

- ### Operation BlueRoof / Rapid Temporary Repair

  Operation BlueRoof and the Rapid Temporary Repair program are FEMA programs
  intended to help victims of large-scale natural disasters (most typically
  hurricanes) get back into their homes quickly. BlueRoof provides thick,
  high-quality blue tarps to act as a temporary roof repair. For other home
  damage, the Rapid Temporary Repair program could replace windows, doors, and
  other structural elements. While FEMA operates both programs, USACE is
  typically tapped to actually execute them.

  My work was focused on converting the paper application process into a more
  streamlined digital process. By getting people's information into the digital
  system directly, we removed the burden of manually entering the information
  from paper forms later and dramatically reduced the risk of paperwork getting
  lost or destroyed, a high risk in a disaster zone. Our work resulted in the
  average turnaround time for tarp deployment from about 20 days to about 2 days.

- ### Interagency Performance Evaluation Taskforce (IPET)

  USACE has a large share of responsibility for the flood protection systems
  along the Mississippi River, including around New Orleans. After Hurricane
  Katrina in 2005 resulted in widespread flooding and flood control system
  failure, USACE launched a systemic study to understand what went wrong and
  how to prevent it happening again. As part of the IPET study team, I led the
  development and maintenance of the data system that all geospatial data
  related to the study was loaded into and disseminated from. This included
  high-resolution LIDAR, satellite spatial photography, aerial photography, and
  much more. For this work, I was awarded a civilian medal by the Army
  Chief of Engineers.
