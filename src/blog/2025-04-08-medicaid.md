## In the beginning

In 2016, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) reached out to
18F. They wanted to help the states more successfully implement their Medicaid
Management Information Systems (MMIS). These are extraordinarily expensive
software systems that handle paying medical providers for work they do for
Medicaid members. And many of them were the same systems that states had built
in the 1980s.

CMS was aware that state MMIS modernizations were failing, costing a lot of
money, and jeopardizing good healthcare outcomes for people in need. As part of
the Affordable Care Act, Congress has authorized the federal government to
reimburse states up to 90% of the cost of their MMIS modernizations, and CMS
was trying to put rules in place to encourage good outcomes and lower costs.
They were on the right track, but states were struggling to figure out how to
implement new systems.

CMS picked five states for us to partner with. The goal was fairly simply:
identify roadblocks to states' success and help them overcome them. With each
state, we spent a few weeks reading through all of the documentation they could
send us about their existing systems, past or ongoing modernization efforts,
contracts, state budget rules, org charts, and... well, really, anything they
would send us. We'd also have meetings with various state and vendor staff to
refine our understanding of the current state of play. Then we held on-site
workshops with each state, establishing a shared understanding of the "as-is"
system, a vision for the "to-be" system, and coaching on product ownership,
user research, and what we called "modular procurement."

## And we oop

We quickly realized that we'd stepped straight into the deep end of the Medicaid
IT pool and were in way over our heads. Our state partners understood what
they needed to do, but they didn't know how to get there. And quite frankly, our
advice wasn't going to help them because some of the biggest hurdles were
coming from inside the house, as it were. CMS's new rules for how to build
Medicaid IT systems were nigh impossible to implement. For example, CMS wanted
states to focus on "modularity," or breaking their Medicaid IT systems into
discrete pieces that could be built independently. The goal was to allow states
to move more quickly and, hopefully, share modules between each other. In
practice, however, states couldn't figure out how to break their systems down,
and honestly, neither could we.

But this wasn't actually the first CMS-imposed roadblock we noticed. Instead,
we kept hearing about Advance Planning Documents (APD). APDs are documents that
state Medicaid offices write to request funding from CMS for building IT
systems, and these were some gigantic documents. States often spent several
months preparing them. The documents had to explain the state's project
management approach, what modules it planned to build, how much it expected
each one to cost, how those costs were to be allocated (e.g., how much was
paying for state employee costs, how much for contracts, how much for travel,
etc.), and detailed timelines. Right on its face, the APD process denied states
the opportunity to be agile and responsive as CMS was demanding.

Worse, the APDs were so information-dense that CMS's state officers – the people
who reviewed and approved the funding requests – needed weeks to months to
review and respond to them. And the documents often contained errors, not least
because the budgetary math was so complex and state officers were required to
send the APDs back if anything was off by even $1. This back-and-forth resulted
in very long times between when a state requested money and when the money was
actually delivered.

## Course correction

By mid-2017, we realized that states could not successfully adopt a more
iterative and flexible approach to building IT systems with the APD process as
it was. We also realized that MMISes were extremely complex and probably not the
right place for us, CMS, or states to be figuring out how to work in this new
way. As a result, we changed course in two distinct ways: first, we suggested to
CMS that we should instead work on the more narrowly-scoped Eligibility and
Enrollment (E&E) Medicaid systems; second, we suggested that CMS let us research
the APD process from the ground up and see if there might be a better way to
meet the statutory and regulatory requirements they are meant to serve.

CMS agreed with us on both fronts. From 2017 until early 2020, we worked
directly with a handful of states on modernizing their Medicaid E&E systems.
These bore fruit, though they were still hampered by APDs and other CMS
requirements.

## Looking at APDs

Meanwhile, we stood up a new team to tackle APDs. This consisted of a metric
ton of interviews with CMS state officers and state Medicaid and acquisitions
professionals. We needed to understand who the APD was meant to serve and how.
We assumed it was entirely for the benefit of CMS, but we quickly learned that
states also used the APDs for their own purposes, including submitting them to
their state legislatures for oversight and budget purposes. We also needed to
know which parts of the APD were truly useful; which parts were not; which
parts were difficult; and who those parts were useful, not, and difficult for.

What we found was that states weren't sure what CMS wanted in the APDs, so they
put in everything they thought might be relevant. One state even included a
history of the state seal! CMS state officers, meanwhile, lamented the amount
of unhelpful information in APDs, such as histories of state seals. All parties
agreed that having a clear template for what should be in an APD would be
helpful. They also agreed that the budget math was too difficult to get right
and it would be super if CMS provided a tool for computing it.

At the end of our research period, we recommended to CMS that they build an
interactive web form for creating APDs. Our argument was that this provided a
way for CMS to clearly specify what information they wanted, to impose
limitations on that information (such as maximum word length, to prevent states
from publishing whole novels in their funding requests), and to build out the
complex Medicaid budget tables correctly and in realtime. We also suggested to
CMS that building such an app would give them a great opportunity to distill the
APD down to just that information that was actually important.

Once again, CMS agreed with us, and with the help of two very eager state
officers, we were able to get approval to start building an APD web app. We
dubbed it eAPD. While the primary goal was to simplify and speed up the process
of drafting, reviewing, and approving APDs, we had secondary goals as well. As
we built the new application together, we were intentionally teaching our
partners at CMS how to be product owners. We were showing them the value of
user research, rapid iterative development, frequent releases, and regular
product demos. We had a hunch that CMS state officers getting hands-on
experience with the process of building software in an agile way would be wildly
beneficial to them when it came time to oversee states doing the same thing.

We worked on eAPD from early 2018 to early 2020. Along the way, we held several
user research sessions that helped us adjust and refine our approach, including
one in which a research participant told us quite bluntly that they hated what
we'd built. As evidence of how well human-centered iterative development works,
however, they later stood on stage at a conference and sang eAPD's praises
(after we'd addressed their concerns, of course). When 18F rolled off eAPD,
CMS continued the work with a contractor, and they had the tools and expertise
to oversee the vendor's work. eAPD went into production for a smaller subset of
Medicaid projects called HITECH in 2021, and CMS reported that APD review times
were substantially shorter.

## APDs aren't the only booger

Throughout 2017 and 2018, we built great relationships with CMS leadership and
staff, and we gained a ton of understanding of how Medicaid programs worked.
Between our projects with states on E&E modernization and our work on eAPD, we
learned a lot about the challenges of Medicaid IT, and because we had so many
simultaneous projects addressing different aspects of Medicaid IT, we also
started seeing relationships between pain points.

This led us to a whole body of work directly with CMS around project oversight
in general. In 2019 alone, 18F and CMS:

- drafted regulatory changes to better describe CMS's oversight role, giving it
  more flexibility in how it engages with states and making it easier for states
  to meet their obligations
- partnered on another project to streamline the submission of required state
  data
- researched the role of state officers from the perspective of both CMS and
  the states they served
- developed a "Rosetta Stone" to help state officers identify when projects were
  at risk so they could intervene sooner
- created a high-level Medicaid IT systems map

But that was _just_ 2019, and the work continued. Together, we developed a
Medicaid Enterprise Systems (MES) health tracker so CMS had a better sense of
how Medicaid modernization was progressing at all times. We also built and ran
a training curriculum for state officers. This was geared towards teaching them
product ownership skills – similar to what we were doing with eAPD, but this
time more abstract, since the state officers were not actively building
anything. Still, we believed that those skills would help them more effectively
identify risks in state project plans. The training also focused on "good"
questions to ask states as the work went along, based on what we had seen
firsthand with states that were struggling.

Perhaps the single biggest piece of work in 2020 was a service design workstream
we led to get everyone in the Medicaid ecosystem on the same page about the
longterm vision for Medicaid IT. CMS, states, and the vendor community all
participated and helped draft a clean and concise view of the future.

We continued this stream of oversight work into 2021. One of the problems we
had identify early on was that CMS seemed to have competing priorities. The
service design workstream had helped to smooth those out, but the risk that
priorities would diverge again was quite high. Together, we built an MES
Alignment Toolkit, which served as a way for CMS to keep their priorities
together across different oversight projects and across time.

Additionally, we kicked off a research project to understand why Medicaid IT
contracts were terminated. CMS knew that contracts were terminated frequently,
and often without cause. These terminations are expensive – the money already
spent is lost, and the projects have to start the process anew. They wanted to
know why it was happening. 18F interviewed a bunch of CMS state officers, state
Medicaid staff, and Medicaid contractors to discuss failed contracts and why
they ended the way they did. Our
[final report](/assets/docs/CMS_Contract_Terminations_Recommendations_Report.pdf)
outlines our findings and recommendations, and this is one of the finest
research reports 18F ever produced.

_One thing our final report doesn't mention is a perverse incentive that states
have to terminate contracts for convenience. If a state terminates for cause
and attempts to recover money from the vendor, CMS will then expect its portion
of that money returned as well. Since CMS foots up to 90% of the bill, that
could mean the state spends far more money in litigation than it will
ultimately get back. For example, if the state recovered $10 million, they
might immediately owe $9 million back to CMS, meaning the state only recovers
$1 million. If litigation takes years, they will have spent far more than that
in legal costs, so it hardly seems worthwhile. We wondered if CMS ought to
impose contract language that allowed CMS to recover funds itself, but we
decided not to go that route for fear of scaring the vendor community._

## Where we landed

The year 2021 was tumultuous for 18F, and political leadership above us stopped
all our work with CMS – against our will and against CMS's. The end of our
years-long relationship gave us time to reflect on what we'd accomplished
together. That was heartening, while also being extremely frustrating given
how close we were to tying up the loose ends we'd left behind in 2016.

By the end of 2021, eAPD was helping states submit funding requests with just
the right amount of information and correct budgetary math while simultaneously
speeding up the review and approval process on the CMS side. This directly
addressed a serious hurdle we found way back in 2016, which was the agonizingly
slow process of getting the money-spigots turned on. CMS also had an excellent
training curriculum for helping its state officers review and monitor state
projects, and it has tools for maintaining a coherent set of priorities.
Finally, CMS, the states, and the Medicaid vendor community have a set of
recommendations to help each work towards better Medicaid IT outcomes.

All of those things were areas of immense friction we'd identified in 2016. And
in those intervening years, 18F had learned a **_LOT_** about Medicaid. Not
only had we worked with CMS to alleviate some of the burden it placed on states,
but we'd also worked with states and vendors directly to build E&E systems,
strengthening the states' product ownership muscles and empowering them to
deliver better results. We were finally ready to dip our toes back into the
MMIS modernization we'd started with.

_Here's a [timeline document](/assets/blog/2025-07-01/18F-Medicaid-timeline.pdf)
showing 18F's work with CMS and states from 2016 through 2021, and how all those
pieces of work related to each other. This was an informal timeline I put
together when our political leadership terminated all our work with CMS, because
I needed to see it laid out to validate my belief that we were close to a major
breakthrough._

## Conclusion

Government work is not fast. It's not supposed to be. The interconnections
between various systems and stakeholders are vast, and they have to be
navigated with great care. They also cannot be dissolved – it's a spider web,
and plucking one string will vibrate all the others. It's important to
understand how a change in one place will ripple throughout the system.

But you also can't wait until you form a perfect understanding, or you'll never
get started. So you have to look around until to find something something that
looks small enough not to be too disruptive. Find a small thing that everything
else depends on but which does not depend on anything else, or the other way
around. The smallest pond, where tossing in a pebble produces the fewest
ripples. And you toss your pebbles into that pond.

It takes a lot of patience to unwind all the pieces and parts that go into a
government service. It takes a lot of humility to recognize and accept that all
those parts exist for a reason. You can't just throw them away. You may be able
to replace them, but you'll need to do it with care. You have to understand what
need they address.

It's not fast work.

But when it's done well, it's beautiful. Done carefully, you save billions of
dollars and provide better outcomes to the people the government serves. That's
the government we deserve.
