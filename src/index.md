# Howdy

This is just a landing page for the stuff I host on GitHub Pages. There probably
won't ever be more here than just this. It's the links below that are cool.

- [Personal README](/readme)
- [Pottery projects](/pottery-projects) - My pottery projects
- [My running log](/running) - How much I've run, how fast, etc.
- [When is going to snow?](/next-snow) - Uses location data from your browser or
  a user-supplied ZIP code to look for the next snow in your forecast.
- [Atlantic hurricanes](/atlantic-hurricanes) - Scrapes the [National Hurricane
  Center website](https://www.nhc.noaa.gov) and extracts just the data bits from the public advisories.
  Then makes maps.
- [CSS sphere](/css-sphere) - An animated globe in CSS. It's janky.
